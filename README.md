Project discription:

Hope to fine-tune llama2 with geno and pheno data. Specifically, fine tune with SNP annotation and related brain traits hope the model can learn the relationship between SNP and brain traits.

Project goal:
- generate discriptions of brain regions using GPT-4 API
- get related SNP using the GWAS results availiable
- get related SNP annotation from Favor dataset
- fine tune the model 
- evalutate the fine-tuned model
- do some more general settings like asking the model questions related but not exactly the same to the prompt to see its generalization ability
