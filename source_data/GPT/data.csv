left caudal anterior cingulate
Anatomy: The left caudal anterior cingulate (cACC) is one of many sub-regions of the larger anterior cingulate cortex found in the brain. It's located in the medial (middle) portion of the brain, near the front. The ACC in general consists of several areas with distinct functions that are differentiated by cytoarchitecture and neurochemical profiles, among other characteristics. The cACC is identified as part of the limbic lobe, which is involved in emotion formation and processing, learning, and memory. Clinical function: Clinically, the left cACC plays both broad and specific roles in emotion control, decision-making, and reward anticipation. It is particularly notable for its involvement in the experience and regulation of pain. Clinically, it's known to play a role in chronic pain conditions, and has also been associated with depression and anxiety, amongst other mental health disorders. Activation in this area of the brain is consistently found in tasks requiring conflict monitoring, response selection, and error detection, showing its intricate involvement in executive functions. Genetic information: The anatomy and function of the left cACC, like all brain structures, are influenced by our genetic makeup. However, connecting this region to specific genes is complicated. It is important to remark that, the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the cACC that contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders are beginning to emerge. Investigations surrounding the cACC often reference genes that are related to neurotransmitter function, such as glutamate and GABA, or those involved in synaptic plasticity. Variability in these genes can lead to differences in the structure or function of the cACC, which, in turn, can influence susceptibility to various neurological or psychiatric conditions.
