It is positioned in the medial part of the cerebral hemisphere, mainly running on the midline along the superior part of the corpus callosum. Being part of the limbic system, this part of the brain is interconnected with various other parts like the prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area and the periaqueductal gray matter. In terms of its properties, the CAC is often delineated from the rest of the anterior cingulate due to its distinct cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture.**Clinical function: The left CAC is closely linked with both cognition and emotion. It plays a crucial role in processes such as anticipation of task, risk assessment, impulse control, decision making, and emotion regulation. A variety of mental health issues like depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been linked to dysfunctions in this area. It is also associated with physical pain cognition. Recent research has pointed to its role in autonomic functions, including blood pressure and heart rate regulation.**Genetic information: Various genes affect the development and function of the left CAC. For instance, the COMT val158met polymorphism is associated with the regulation of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, which is closely linked to the functions of the CAC. Other genes like VAMP2, associated with neurotransmitter release, and NRG1, implicated in neurodevelopment, have also been connected to this brain region. Variations in these genes may impact the structural and functional characteristics of the CAC, thereby influencing susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.
pheno9,left lateral occipital,Anatomy: The left lateral occipital cortex, located in the occipital lobe of the brain, forms a part of the larger cerebral cortex structure. It is positioned on the brain's left hemisphere, next to the occipital bone that gives the lobe its name. Specifically, this region includes the Brodmann areas 18 and 19, which constitute the visual processing center. No physical division separates the left and right lateral occipital cortices, but they perform different tasks due to lateralization in the brain's functions.**Clinical function: The primary function of the left lateral occipital cortex, like its counterpart on the right, is related to visual processing; however, it performs tasks with more of a specialty for the visual conception of words. It's heavily involved in the recognition and understanding of written languages, contributing significantly to reading competency. Damage to this area can often lead to alexia, a condition characterized by an inability to understand written words, indicating its essential role in language processing. Furthermore, this region assists in the perception of visual data like shapes, spaces, and movement, helping form a complete visual experience.**Genetic information: Genetic influence on the structure and function of the left lateral occipital cortex is not fully understood, and research is still ongoing. However, studies like those from the ENIGMA consortium hint towards a considerable genetic influence on cortical thickness in this region. Variations in the left lateral occipital cortex's makeup have been linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes, including those associated with neuronal migration and differentiation. However, it’s crucial to appreciate that genetic expression in the brain is complex and influenced by various factors, including environmental ones. The area remains an active focus of research to further understand genetic influences on its structure, connectivity, and function.*
pheno5,left fusiform,Anatomy: The left fusiform is part of the fusiform gyri, located on the basal surface of the brain, primarily on the inferior temporal gyrus. It is an area known to have involvement in higher-level visual processing. This gyrus gets its name from its spindle or cigar shape. It is bordered medially by the parahippocampal gyrus and laterally by the inferior temporal gyrus. Neuroanatomically, it contains three main subdivisions: occipital, middle, and anterior, with each part having unique connectivity and function.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left fusiform plays a crucial role in several cognitive functions, primarily reading and facial recognition. Damage to the left fusiform gyrus can result in alexia or inability to read, while damage to the right fusiform gyrus can lead to prosopagnosia or an inability to recognize faces. Its uniquely organized lateralization is thought to help in the speed and efficiency of processing visual stimuli. Furthermore, increased activation in left fusiform regions has been associated with semantic processing tasks which highlights its potential broader role in object recognition and semantic encoding.**Genetic Information: While there is limited knowledge regarding the specific genetic influences on the structure and function of the left fusiform gyrus, several studies indicate a genetic role in its development and function. For instance, research into dyslexia has shown a possible link between DCDC2 (a gene related to brain development) and structural differences in the left fusiform gyrus. Likewise, a study on facial recognition has suggested that the genetic factor might influence the fusiform face area's size, a highly specialized region in the fusiform gyrus. Nevertheless, many factors affecting left fusiform structure and function, such as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, remain inadequately understood and need further research.
pheno3,left cuneus,Anatomy: The left cuneus is a small region located in the occipital lobe of the brain. It falls within Brodmann area 17, and is one of the two occipital subdivisions which are split by the calcarine fissure. It is posterior to the lingual gyrus and sits above the calcarine sulcus. The cuneus specializes in primary visual processing that relays visual information from the contralateral (opposite) visual field. Its position in the dorsal part allows it to have intimate connections with various structural pathways and neighboring areas involved in visual processing.**Clinical function: The left cuneus plays a vital role in the visual process. It receives direct inputs from the optic radiations, contributing towards vision and visual field perception. Moreover, the cuneus has been implicated in various clinical conditions due to its involvement in perception and cognition. Abnormalities or lesions in this region could result in clinical conditions like visual field deficits, akinetopsia (motion blindness), and color agnosia. Beyond that, the left cuneus has been implicated in mental imagery, attention modulation, episodic memory retrieval, and number processing, to list but a few.**Genetic information: While the cuneus does not have any direct genetic information or genes linked to its structure or function, it is worth noting that the development and functionality of the brain, and therefore the cuneus, is influenced by a vast multitude of genes. These genes are involved in various aspects like neuronal growth, connection patterns, neurotransmitter production, synaptic function and in brain-specific pathways. Disruptions or abnormalities in any of these genetic influences can possibly lead to malfunction or development issues in the left cuneus and result in neurological disorders.
pheno2,left caudal middle frontal,Anatomy: The left caudal middle frontal region pertains to an area in the frontal lobe of the brain, specifically located in the posterior section of the middle frontal gyrus. This region plays an integral role in the brain's division of tasks, known as lateralization.

In terms of the brain's anatomy, the neural connectivity of this region is particularly dense, signaling its important role in facilitating various cognitive activities.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left caudal middle frontal region is recognized for its contribution to various higher cognitive functions. Primarily, this region plays a significant role in language production and comprehension. Also, it is involved in executive functions such as decision-making, problem-solving, planning, and social behavior regulation. Dysfunctions or damages within this area can lead to various cognitive impairments, including language disorders like aphasia and dyslexia, attention deficits, and issues with memory and spatial orientation. It is also known to be linked with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's.**Genetic information: Current genomic research indicates multiple gene expressions in the left caudal middle frontal region but a comprehensive genetic map of this area is still under investigation. However, studies identified several candidate genes that may affect the structure and function of the left caudal middle frontal region. These include genes related to neurodevelopment and synaptogenesis, such as NRG1 and DISC1, implicated in schizophrenia. Additionally, the APOE gene involved in Alzheimer's disease may also impact this region. The genetic variations of these mentioned genes may influence the function, connectivity, or morphology of the left caudal middle frontal area, potentially contributing to the onset and progression of various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
pheno6,left inferior parietal,Anatomy: The left inferior parital lobe, part of the brain's cortex, lies beneath the parietal bone's posterior part. Its primary division is into the supramarginal gyrus and the angular gyrus. The supramarginal gyrus forms a border with the lateral sulcus and is responsible for spatial awareness and orientation. The angular gyrus, situated near the superior edge of the temporal lobe, plays essential roles in language comprehension and the processing of visual information. The left inferior parietal lobe is also heavily involved in the Default Mode Network (DMN), a group of interacting brain regions with activity highly correlated with each other, but not with the rest of the brain.**Clinical function: The left inferior parietal lobe holds significant importance in understanding written and spoken language, mathematical operations, body image, and spatial orientation. Its damage often results in conditions like Gerstmann's syndrome, characterized by agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation. It also plays a role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), where decreased activation in areas including the left inferior parietal cortex is observed. Additionally, research has linked this region to social cognition difficulties in autism spectrum disorders and alterations in patients with schizophrenia.**Genetic information: Over the years, genetic studies have made significant strides in understanding the left inferior parietal lobe's genetic influence. Notable genes associated with this brain region are the ATP2B2, MACROD2, and CHRM2, which are implicated in cognitive disorders. Also noteworthy is the Apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 genotype which has been shown to have a considerable effect on the metabolism of the left inferior parietal lobule, potentially leading to Alzheimer's disease. While more research is needed, these genes hint at the complex genetic impacts that shape the left inferior parietal lobe's structure and functions.
pheno4,left entorhinal,Anatomy: The left entorhinal cortex is a key component of the medial temporal lobe located in the brain, playing a significant role in memory systems and spatial navigation. It acts as a hub in a widespread network for memory and navigation. The region is divided into two parts: the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which are associated with object recognition and spatial memory, respectively. They differ in their connections and functionality, but both are critical gateways for information entering the hippocampus, a part of the cerebral cortex.**Clinical function: The entorhinal cortex plays a vital role in both declarative memory and mapping external environments. The left entorhinal cortex specifically may be more associated with verbal memory processing. This cortex is also one of the first regions of the brain to be affected by neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, leading to memory loss and disorientation. In fact, the seriousness of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia may be linked to the degree of degeneration in the entorhinal cortex. **Genetic information: Studies on genetic influence on the left entorhinal cortex indicate that certain genes, including the APOE gene, can increase the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This gene comes in several different forms, with APOE ε4 increasing the risk of acquiring the disease and APOE ε2 decreasing it. In mouse studies, the Entorhinal Cortex Gene (Ecg) was shown to be expressed predominantly and specifically in the entorhinal cortex, however, the role this gene in humans still needs to be explored. Neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex has been associated with numerous other genes; understanding these genetic variations could provide deeper insights into why some people are more susceptible to certain neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions.
pheno12,left medial orbitofrontal,Anatomy: The left medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is a vital part of the brain located in the frontal lobes, in the prefrontal cortex region. It's placed above the orbits (eye sockets), hence, its nomenclature. This region also incorporates Brodmann areas 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, and 32. Furthermore, the orbitofrontal cortex is divided into the medial and lateral regions, and the left medial orbitofrontal region is part of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.**Clinical function: The left medial OFC plays a significant role in decision making, emotion, social behavior, and reward-related cognition. It's crucial for the adaptive learning ability—continually re-evaluating information to adjust plans or behaviors. When it comes to emotional processing, this region helps in interpreting the emotional value of various stimuli, contributing to emotional regulation. Furthermore, it plays a role in inhibitory control, enabling a person to suppress instinctive or learned responses. Damage or abnormalities in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex can result in varying psychopathologies, like depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. **Genetic information: Studies have suggested different genes can be associated with changes in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex, which may be linked with mental illnesses. For instance, the CACNA1C gene variant has been linked to changes in the left medial OFC. The volume of the left medial orbitofrontal cortex is also related to the genetic risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Further studies are needed to understand fully the genetic underpinnings of this complex brain region and how various genes influence its functionality and structure.
pheno17,left pars orbitalis,Anatomy: The left pars orbitalis is part of the frontal lobe in the brain, specifically located within the inferior frontal gyrus, which is situated in Broca's area. The region is near the lateral sulcus that separates the frontal and temporal lobes. The frontal lobe’s inferior surface is made up of three horizontal gyrus - the orbital part, triangular part and opercular part - with the pars orbitalis being the most anterior part of them. **Clinical function: The left pars orbitalis plays a significant role in language processing and production, as it is part of Broca’s area, which is typically tied to these functions. It is crucial to speech production, semantic tasks, and other cognitive functions. Lesions or damage to this area can lead to severe language deficits such as Broca's aphasia, a condition characterized by reduced sentence production and agrammatism. Apart from its role in language skills, recent studies suggest it might also be involved in decision making and social cognitive tasks. **Genetic information: There is limited specific genetic information directly related to the left pars orbitalis. However, general brain development, which includes the development of the left pars orbitalis, is influenced by a multitude of genes. Various genetic abnormalities or mutations can potentially affect its development and function. For example, FOXP2 gene mutations have been implicated in language and speech disorders, potentially indicating a connection to regions such as Broca's area, which includes the left pars orbitalis.
pheno15,left paracentral,Anatomy: The left paracentral lobule is part of the cerebral cortex located in the brain's frontal lobe, superior to the medial aspect of the brain. It lies near the longitudinal fissure, the deep groove separating the two cerebral hemispheres. This region of the brain comprises part of the precentral and postcentral gyri, intertwined with the anterior and posterior paracentral gyri. Thus, it serves as a junction of sorts between regions controlling motor and sensory functions.**Clinical Function: The left paracentral lobule plays a significant role in both motor and sensory functions. The anterior part of the lobule, which corresponds to the precentral gyrus, is primarily involved with voluntary motor function—it controls the contralateral (right) lower extremity. The posterior part of the lobule, corresponding with the postcentral gyrus, is concerned with sensory functions—it perceives sensations such as touch and proprioception from the right lower extremity. In stroke cases affecting this area, patients may present with contralateral sensory loss and/or motor weakness affecting the lower extremity.**Genetic Information: The genetic basis for specific localization of brain functions, such as in the left paracentral lobule, is not entirely understood. It is believed that numerous genes interact with environmental factors to control the development and arrangement of different brain areas. Recent genome-wide association studies have linked certain genetic variations with differences in brain morphology. However, understanding how these variations impact specific brain functions is still the subject of ongoing research. Currently, no specific genes have been directly linked to the functions or development of the left paracentral lobule.
pheno13,left middle temporal,Anatomy: The left middle temporal gyrus is part of the cerebral cortex situated between the superior and inferior temporal sulci in the human brain. Its name corresponds to its position in the middle of the temporal part of the cerebral cortex; it lies parallel to the lateral sulcus and is responsible for processing sensory input into derived meanings for appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association. As a component of the brain's temporal lobe, it maintains connectivity with numerous other brain areas, including frontal and parietal lobes, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus.**Clinical function: In the clinical context, the left middle temporal gyrus plays a critical role in memory processing, particularly explicit long-term memory about objects and/or people and language processing. It helps in understanding and processing spoken language and is involved in semantic memory and visual perception. It is associated with disorders like Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, and semantic dementia when there are alterations or injuries. It is also critical for facial recognition, with studies associating dysfunction in the middle temporal gyrus with prosopagnosia, a disorder of face perception. **Genetic information: The genetic influences on the structure and function of the left middle temporal gyrus are not completely understood, due in part to the complex interplay between many genes that contribute to brain development and function. However, genetics does play a substantial role in shaping the human brain, and therefore also has an impact on the middle temporal gyrus. For example, certain genetic mutations have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders that affect the middle temporal gyrus. However, more research is needed to identify the specific genes that affect this brain region and how they influence its structure and function.
pheno11,left lingual,Anatomy: The left lingual is closely related to the tongue's anatomy, specifically the left side. The tongue, including the left side or left lingual, is a muscular organ in the oral cavity that plays a significant role in different processes such as speech, deglutition, and taste sensation. It comprises two primary muscles groups: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic muscles modify the shape of the tongue, while the extrinsic muscles adjust its position. The upper surface of the tongue known as the dorsum is coated with various types of papillae that house the tastebuds. The left lingual nerve supplies sensory innervation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, including touch, temperature, and taste sensation.**Clinical function: Clinically, the function of the left lingual plays an integral role in speech articulation, mastication, and swallowing. Furthermore, it has a specialized role in taste sensation as the tongue is the primary organ for taste in humans. Disorders, injuries, or infections involving the left lingual can impact these functions. For example, damage to the left lingual nerve during dental procedures can lead to a range of complications such as lingual nerve paraesthesia, temporary or permanent altered sensation, numbness, and even loss of taste.**Genetic information: Although there is no specific gene solely responsible for the left lingual function, its development, like the entire tongue, is controlled by several genes. Notable among these genes are the homeobox genes, such as the HOX and the SHH (sonic hedgehog) gene families. Alterations in these genes can result in tongue malformation. It must be highlighted that further research is required to understand the intricacies of the genetics governing the development and function of the tongue, including the left lingual.
pheno16,left pars opercularis,Anatomy: The left pars opercularis is an anatomical part of the frontal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere which is usually on the left side in the brain. This region is found in Brodmann Area 44 and it forms part of the Broca's Area along with the pars triangularis. The pars opercularis is bordered by the precentral gyrus behind and the pars triangularis ahead. In relation to its internal structure, it is connected with other brain regions like the basal ganglia and the anterior cingulate cortex through circuits primarily composed of white matter tracts.**Clinical function: The left pars opercularis serves critical roles in language comprehension and speech production, as it forms part of the Broca's area. Studies have revealed its function in phonological processes, syntactic processing, and even in sign language in individuals who are deaf. When lesions occur in this area of the brain, both expressive and receptive aphasia may result—an inability to express oneself using speech or difficulty understanding speech. Moreover, research suggests this region is involved in certain cognitive tasks like working memory and attention, and in non-verbal tasks as well, such as the execution and imagination of complex motor tasks.**Genetic information: Certain genetic factors appear to influence the structure and function of the left pars opercularis. For instance, a study found that expression of the FOXP2 gene, a gene implicated in speech and language disorders, is associated with the structural basis of the left hemisphere language network including the left pars opercularis. Moreover, allele variations in FOXP2 gene have been correlated with both improved and impaired performance on linguistic tasks related to this region. Other genes that affect brain structure and cognition may indeed influence the development and performance of the left pars opercularis, but further research is needed to elucidate these associations.
pheno19,left pericalcarine,Anatomy: The left pericalcarine is a structure situated within the cerebral hemisphere of the brain. It forms a part of the occipital lobe, which is known for processing visual information. The pericalcarine cortex gets its name from its close proximity to the calcarine fissure, a landmark sulcus or groove, on the medial aspect of the brain. This region mainly contains the primary visual cortex or V1, making it indispensable in the visual pathway of the human central nervous system.**Clinical Function: The left pericalcarine plays an indispensable role in our ability to interpret and understand visual information. It forms part of the primary visual cortex (also known as V1 or Brodmann area 17), the processing stage for visual information coming from the retina. This region is responsible for basic vision processes such as edge detection, spatial orientation and color discrimination. Damage to this area can lead to a wide range of visual perception issues, like loss of vision in certain areas of the visual field, difficulty recognizing colors, or problems with motion perception.**Genetic Information: The left pericalcarine, like all regions of the brain, is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While specific genes have not been directly linked to the structure and function of the pericalcarine, studies have found that individual variations in brain anatomy are highly heritable, including in regions related to visual processing. Variations in the size, thickness, or volume of the pericalcarine could thus potentially be linked to genetic differences. Future research in the field of neurogenetics may provide more insight into the specific genes that contribute to the development and function of the left pericalcarine.
pheno14,left parahippocampal,Anatomy: The left parahippocampal gyrus is a part of the limbic system in the brain, located in the medial temporal lobe. It consists of the perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. It is positioned between the hippocampus and the fissure of Sylvius, wrapping around the posterior end of the Sylvius fissure. The parahippocampal gyrus works closely with the hippocampus in memory processing and has direct connections to the amygdala, which is essential for emotional processing.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left parahippocampal gyrus plays a crucial role in memory encoding and retrieval, particularly spatial memory and scene recognition. It is involved in the processing of complex visual scenes and contexts, and its functioning affects our contextual and environmental episodic memory. Damage to the parahippocampal gyrus can lead to memory impairment and difficulty in scene recognition. It is also implicated in various psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, which often present with significant memory impairments.**Genetic information: Genetic studies on the parahippocampal gyrus are still somewhat limited. However, some genetic variants have been found to influence the functioning and structure of the parahippocampal gyrus. For instance, certain genes such as BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) have been associated with the volume of the parahippocampal region. Additionally, variations in APOE (Apolipoprotein E) genes have been associated with the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, and it's known to influence the thickness of the parahippocampal gyrus. It is important to note that genetic influence on brain structures is determined by many genes, each contributing a small effect, and is further modulated by environmental factors.
pheno20,left postcentral,Anatomy: The postcentral gyrus, also referred to as the primary somatosensory cortex, is a crucial structure located in the parietal lobe of the human brain. The left postcentral gyrus, situated in the left hemisphere of the brain, runs parallel to the central sulcus. It is responsible for receiving and processing sensory information from the right side of the body, given the contralateral function of the brain. The somatotopic organization characteristic of this region reflects a corresponding map of various body parts, with specific zones dedicated to specific anatomical entities.**Clinical function: The left postcentral gyrus plays a vital role in processing sensory inputs including touch, pressure, temperature, and pain from the right side of the body. It contributes to the perception of proprioception, which is the awareness of the position and movements of our body parts, which is critical for coordination and movement. Damage or disease affecting this area can result in sensory deficits, impairments in proprioception or spatial processing difficulties. Conditions such as stroke, tumors, epilepsy, or neurodegenerative diseases can impact the function of the postcentral gyrus and manifest clinically relevant symptoms.**Genetic Information: The genetic basis for the specific functions of left postcentral gyrus is still under investigation, but it's known that many complex genetic factors contribute to the overall development and function of the brain. Certain gene variations may affect the structure or function of the postcentral gyrus and potentially increase susceptibility to neural diseases. For instance, aberrations in gene expressions, DNA methylation alterations, copy number variations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with a range of neurological conditions. Further, emerging research on gene-brain associations also suggests a role of the DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1) gene in shaping the structural and functional integrity of the postcentral gyrus. As with the rest of the brain, the postcentral gyrus is subject to the influence of both genetic and environmental factors.
pheno18,left pars triangularis,Anatomy: The left pars triangularis is part of Broca's area, which is located in the frontal lobe of the left hemisphere of the brain. The Broca area, which also comprises the pars opercularis, is located in the posterior part of the frontal lobes. The pars triangularis is named for its triangular shape and is situated between the superior and middle frontal gyri. It is bordered by the lateral sulcus and the anterior ascending branch of the lateral sulcus. This region of the brain is known to be involved in language production and comprehension.**Clinical function: In the context of clinical function, the left pars triangularis plays a critical role in expressive speech. Damage to this area of the brain, such as from stroke or traumatic brain injury, can result in Broca's aphasia. This condition is marked by difficulties in constructing sentences and speech that is halting and effortful. However, comprehension remains generally intact. The left pars triangularis, along with the rest of Broca's area, is also crucial for tasks like repeating sentences or phrases. Thus, the clinical assessment of this region is important in identifying and managing disorders related to language and motor speech.**Genetic information: Although a direct genetic basis determining the size and function of left pars triangularis is not yet established, twin and family studies suggest a degree of heritability. Research indicates certain genetic variations may be associated with structural variations in this area. A study by Pinel and colleagues (2012) found that a specific variation in the KIAA0319 gene was associated with the asymmetry of the left pars triangularis. Larger and earlier-developing left pars triangularis is associated with left-handedness and dyslexia. However, much is still unknown about the specific genetic factors influencing the development and functionality of the left pars triangularis, necessitating further research in this area.
pheno23,left precuneus,Anatomy: The left precuneus is located in the superior parietal lobule on the medial surface of the brain's left hemisphere. Structurally, it is part of the parietal cortex, situated anterior to the cuneus. It has connections with numerous other cortical regions, including the prefrontal cortex, other parietal areas, and the occipital lobe. This structure is associated with consciousness and different cognitive functions due to its ample connections to other important brain regions.**Clinical Function: Functionally, the left precuneus plays a significant role in a variety of cognitive processes. Primarily, it is involved in episodic memory, or the ability to recall specific events and experiences in the past. Furthermore, it contributes to visuospatial processing, allowing for the perception of spatial relationships and the manipulation of objects. It is also implicated in self-related mental representations and consciousness. Clinical dysfunctions in the left precuneus have been associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD due to its functional roles.**Genetic Information: As per the current scientific consensus, the exact genetic coding responsible for the development and functions of the left precuneus is not completely understood. The precuneus is not associated with one specific gene. However, it is clear that its development and functioning are influenced by a collection of genes. Some genetic variations have been proposed as risk factors for diseases affecting the precuneus, such as Alzheimer's disease, hence, further research is required to completely understand the genetic basis of the left precuneus and its functions.
pheno21,left posterior cingulate,Anatomy: The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), located in the medial region of the brain, is a significant part of the limbic system involved in coordinating information from multiple areas of the brain. It forms part of the cingulate cortex, including the isthmus, and connects to various other regions like the prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Notably, the left part of the PCC plays an identical role as the right part, differing only in managing the right side's sensory and motor functions.**Clinical function: The left posterior cingulate is primarily involved in controlling conscious attention. It processes information about internal and external stimuli, helping shift and maintain attention. This region also plays a role in creating and recalling autobiographical memories. Clinically, abnormal activity or damage in this area of the brain has been linked to numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The posterior cingulate cortex also demonstrates the first region of hypometabolism in Alzheimer's disease, particularly making it an area of interest in early diagnosis of this condition.**Genetic information: Current research in genomics and neuroimaging have contributed to the understanding of the underlying genetic influences on the structure and function of the posterior cingulate cortex. Certain genes and genetic variations have been associated with alterations in this brain region.

It is interconnected with other areas of the brain through the occipital lobe’s white matter tracts, allowing information to be transmitted to and from this region. Also, the right lateral occipital area is one of the significant areas involved in the brain’s dorsal and ventral visual pathways used for processing spatial and non-spatial visual information, respectively.**Clinical function: Clinically, the primary function of the right lateral occipital area involves the visual perception and integration of the visual stimuli. It is essentially involved in the 'where' pathway (dorsal stream) of visual processing, which is responsible for processing the location and movement of objects. Damages in this area can lead to several neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, such as visual field defects, and may cause visual-spatial disorders like inability to recognize faces (prosopagnosia), objects (agnosia), and difficulties orienting in space. This region also plays a role in the perception of color and motion in the visual field.**Genetic information: The genetic information of the right lateral occipital area is vastly understudied and remains poorly understood. However, several studies pointed out a few genetic factors influencing the anatomy and function of the occipital lobe. The PAX6 gene mutation, for instance, has been shown to affect the size of the occipital lobe in humans and can lead to anomalies in the visual processing areas. Other genetic variants in the TBR1 and AUTS2 genes are found to be associated with the morphological variability of the occipital lobe. Future exploration in genetics would likely provide a broader understanding of how genetic variants influence the structure and function of the occipital lobe region.

These gene variations may influence the number of neurons, the extent of connections between neurons, and the level or effectiveness of neurotransmitters in the orbitofrontal cortex. Further genetic studies will be needed to understand these relationships more clearly.
pheno46,right paracentral,Anatomy: The right paracentral lobule is found in the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus in the human brain. It is part of the cerebral cortex and sits just anterior to the paracentral sulcus, and posterior to the cingulate gyrus. This particular cortical region is divided into anterior and posterior portions, each with their specific cellular architecture and functions. In general, it forms part of the motor and sensory areas of the cerebral cortex.**Clinical function: The right paracentral lobule holds importance in executing and regulating various motor and sensorimotor functions. Specifically, it houses the primary somatosensory and motor cortices which process sensory input from and send motor commands to the contralateral (opposite side) lower body and legs. Interestingly, it also plays a role in controlling urinary bladder function. Damage or disruption to this area could result in clinical manifestations such as contralateral lower limb weakness, sensory loss, or micturition disorders.**Genetic information: The genetic contribution to the anatomy and function of the right paracentral lobule is complex, influenced by several genes involved in neural development, function, and maintenance. Specific genetic variants may also impact individual differences in folding patterns or size of this cortical region. However, detailed genetic information about the right paracentral lobule is currently limited and a subject of ongoing research. Generally, genetic disorders like lissencephaly which affects the entire brain's development may also affect the development of the right paracentral lobule. Similarly, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease or ALS that have a significant genetic component may cause functional changes in this region.
pheno47,right pars opercularis,Anatomy: The right pars opercularis is a subpart of the frontal gyrus, located in the Broca’s area of the human brain, primarily associated with speech production. In the larger demarcation, it falls under the precentral gyrus. Though the precise anatomy can vary, generally, it segregates from the pars triangularis by the ascending ramus, and from the precentral gyrus by the central sulcus. The exact location can be recognized on the lateral surface of the brain, covering the operculum. **Clinical function: The clinical functionality of the right pars opercularis leans towards language production and comprehension, particularly inhibiting responses until the timing for speech articulation is appropriate. Damage to this region can result in expressive aphasia, or Broca's aphasia, characterized by reduced speech production, and it may also impact motor skills due to its connection to the frontal lobe. Research has signified its role in the function of action words and verb generation as well. **Genetic information: Genetic influence on the right pars opercularis is still under extensive scientific research. As of the available information, FOXP2 gene is known to be essential for normal speech and language development. The disruptions or mutations in the FOXP2 gene might affect the neuronal mechanisms or the structural development of the regions including the pars opercularis, disrupting language-related processes. Additionally, twin studies imply a high degree of heritability in anatomic variations of the pars opercularis, pointing to the significance of genetic factors on its development and functional efficiencies.
pheno48,right pars orbitalis,Anatomy: The right pars orbitalis is a subdivision of the inferior frontal gyrus, positioned in the frontal lobe of the human brain. This region is located toward the right side of the prefrontal cortex, broadening the area above the eye socket (or orbit). Its positioning places it in close proximity to Broca’s area, the portion of the brain predominantly responsible for the production of speech. **Clinical function: The right pars orbitalis plays a significant role in various cognitive functions. According to studies, it is actively involved in language processing and phonological working memory, which is crucial for understanding and producing language. Moreover, the right pars orbitalis is also engaged in managing inhibitory control, which includes refraining from an urge to act, shifting attention, or stopping an ongoing response. Abnormalities or damage in this part of the brain can lead to speech and language impairments, including Broca's Aphasia and difficulty in understanding complex sentences. **Genetic information: Several genetic factors can influence the anatomy and function of the right pars orbitalis. One study notes that certain genetic variants, such as polymorphism in the FOXP2 gene, can affect the size of this area. This gene is thought to be a primary contributor to language processing and may also be associated with neurodevelopmental disorders affecting speech and language. Different genetic disorders can cause structural changes in the right pars orbitalis, resulting in affecting its clinical function. However, further study is required to better understand the relationship between genetics and the anatomy & function of the right pars orbitalis.
pheno44,right middle temporal,Anatomy: The right middle temporal gyrus (MTG) is one of the three gyri in the temporal lobe of the human brain. Sciendirect states it runs in parallel along with the superior temporal gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral medial temporal cortex, including the MTG, is primarily related to high-level visual processing and recognition memory. Functional areas within the gyrus include the variant Brodmann areas 21 and 37. Additionally, the right middle temporal gyrus interfaces with the limbic system, more specifically with the fusiform gyrus and the parahippocampal gyrus.  **Clinical function: The right middle temporal gyrus plays a critical role in various cognitive functions. One of these includes semantic memory processing, as discovered through neurocognitive studies. Moreover, it involves in visual perception, helping recognize and categorize objects and faces. The MTG is also linked with social cognition, specifically in interpreting others' feelings and intentions. Its right lateralization suggests its possible involvement in inhibitory control. According to a study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, & Psychiatry, the MTG's dysfunction is implicated in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, Autism, Schizophrenia, and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).**Genetic information: Though the genetic makeup of the right middle temporal gyrus does not pertain to any specific gene, several genes do have an impact on its overall structure and function. For example, certain variations of the APOE gene increase the risk of Alzheimer's and can cause structural changes in the MTG, possibly including atrophy. Changes in other genes, such as BDNF, COMT, and DISC1, also influence the function and structure of the MTG and can increase susceptibility to psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. Furthermore, per Genome Biology, common variants near gene AS3MT are associated with the volume of the right middle temporal gyrus. These findings suggest that genetics play a significant role in the MTG's anatomy and its functionality.*
pheno49,right pars triangularis,Anatomy: The Right Pars Triangularis is a part of the frontal lobe in the human brain. It's located in Broca’s area which is usually linked with speech production. This region is named due to its triangular shape. The right pars triangularis is bordered by the superior frontal sulcus from the top, the lateral sulcus from the bottom, and the inferior frontal sulcus from the back. It has two gyri - anterior and posterior, divided by a horizontal fissure.**Clinical function: The primary role of the right pars triangularis is associated with language speech and production; however, the right hemisphere has been found to be more involved with non-verbal functions such as visuospatial processing, music, and emotion processing in right-handed individuals. Therefore, the right pars triangularis could have a role in the modulation of tonal inflection, understanding of metaphors, jokes, sarcasm, and other non-literal forms of language. Damage to this area can result in non-fluent aphasia, causing difficulties in speech production while comprehension remains largely unaffected. **Genetic information: Few studies have attempted to link the heritability and genetic factors of the right pars triangularis. Some variants in the FOXP2 gene, often linked to language and speech development, have been shown to be associated with the volume of the right pars triangularis, suggesting a possible genetic influence on its structure. Other studies indicate that the brain's morphology, including the right pars triangularis, is under strong genetic control with heritability estimates up to 80% in twin studies. Nonetheless, more research is required to understand specific genetic factors influencing the development and functioning of the right pars triangularis.
pheno50,right pericalcarine,Anatomy: The right pericalcarine cortex is located within the occipital lobe of the brain, this area is responsible for visual processing and is positioned around the calcarine sulcus. Its primary function is related to the human visual system. Specifically, it contains the primary visual cortex, also known as Brodmann area 17. This brain region is structured to receive visual information from the retinas, its position in the medial aspect of the brain allows it to directly obtain and process visual input from the binocular field of vision, ensuring that all visual information is correctly processed. **Clinical function: Clinically, a disruption in the function of the right pericalcarine cortex could lead to several vision disorders. Given its crucial role in processing visual stimuli, damage due to illness, trauma or a pathological condition can result in visual field defects, often presenting as a condition called hemianopia where half of the visual field is lost. Conditions such as stroke, tumors, head injuries, brain surgeries, or severe migraines could negatively affect the right pericalcarine cortex. The cortical region may also play a role in conditions like hallucinations and cognitive disorders. **Genetic information: The occurrence, development, function, and potential disorders associated with the right pericalcarine cortex could have a genetic underpinning, as do many aspects of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. Although it is difficult to link specific genes to individual brain regions, several genes might influence the development and function of the visual cortex. For instance, the RORB gene which is a member of RAR-related orphan receptors, is highly expressed in the visual cortex and solute carrier family guide the transmission of signals in this area. The genetic aspects of brain regions remain a topic of research, further studies are required to fully elucidate the complex genetic orchestration of brain development and function.
pheno51,right postcentral,Anatomy: The right postcentral gyrus is located in the parietal lobe of the brain, immediately posterior to the central sulcus. It spans both the lateral and medial surfaces of the hemisphere and is the primary cortical region responsible for somatosensation, or sensory perception of the body and its environment. It receives input primarily from the contralateral (opposite) side of the body and is organized somatotopically, meaning that specific areas of the gyrus correspond to specific parts of the body. **Clinical function: The right postcentral gyrus plays a crucial role in the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain processing. Since the right postcentral gyrus receives most of its sensory input from the left side of the body, damage to this area can lead to visitant deficits in tactile and proprioceptive perception on the contralateral side. Pain, temperature, pressure, and touch sensations pass through this gyrus before they are interpreted by the brain. It also plays a vital role in perceiving the shape and texture of objects, and the awareness of body position and movement (proprioception).**Genetic information: The development, functioning, and potential alteration of the right postcentral gyrus can be influenced by different genes. Specific genes implicated include those involved in neuronal migration, axon guidance, myelination, and synapse formation, which are essential for the establishment and maintenance of neural circuits in this region. Genetic aberrations might lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, like those in the autism spectrum, although the exact genetic contributions to function and dysfunction of the right postcentral gyrus are still being explored and understood in neurogenetic research. No single gene can be directly associated with the functions of right postcentral gyrus, as its development and functionality are the results of complex interactions of many genes.
pheno52,right posterior cingulate,Anatomy: The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a key part of the limbic system, located at the rear of the cingulate cortex in the cerebral hemisphere of the brain towards the back and above the corpus callosum. It works in coordination with the anterior cingulate cortex, forming a united system. The PCC boasts key connections to various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and various parts of the parietal cortex, while also principally connecting to the default mode network, a group of interacting brain regions with activity highly linked to introspective states.**Clinical function: Clinically, the right posterior cingulate plays a significant role in various cognitive functions, primarily memory and spatial orientation. It contributes to recall and recognition of memory, and it associates emotionally significant context to memories. Studies have also shown that the PCC is involved in visuospatial processing and internally-directed cognition. Abnormalities or damage to this area can lead to cognitive and memory disorders. Notably, the PCC is one of the first regions affected by Alzheimer's disease, with decreased activity linked to amyloid deposition in early stages of the disease.**Genetic information: Genetic studies have indicated that several genes influence the structure and function of the right posterior cingulate. For instance, variants of the APOE gene, particularly the APOE4 variant, have been associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's and are linked to metabolic decrements in the right PCC. Additionally, genetic variations in the BDNF and COMT genes, both of which are involved in cognitive functions, may also influence the functioning of the PCC. However, the complete genetic profile and its influences on the structure and function of the right posterior cingulate remain an active area of research.
pheno59,right superior temporal,Anatomy: The right superior temporal gyrus is a part of the human brain, residing in the temporal lobe, one of the four major lobes of the brain. It is bordered by the lateral sulcus, the superior temporal sulcus, and the lateral fissure. This gyrus is implicated in auditory processing, including the perception of speech and music. It is also involved in high-level visual processing and multisensory integration, particularly combining sounds and visuals. **Clinical function: In a clinical setting, the superior temporal gyrus plays critical roles in language comprehension and production. Damage or abnormalities in this area can lead to language disorders like Wernicke’s aphasia. Patients with such conditions may have fluent but nonsensical speech and impaired understanding of spoken or written language. Besides, this gyrus is also involved in social cognition. Impaired functioning in this area is often seen in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction. **Genetic information: Current research focuses on the genetic links to superior temporal gyrus anatomy and its functions. Certain gene polymorphisms can influence the volume and structural connectivity of the superior temporal gyrus, and in turn, affect its function. For example, certain genetic variations associated with autism are linked to structural changes in the superior temporal gyrus. However, the understanding of the genetic basis of the superior temporal gyrus anatomy and its function is still in its infancy, requiring more comprehensive genetic, imaging, and phenotypic data.*
pheno53,right precentral,Anatomy: The right precentral gyrus, also known as the primary motor cortex, is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. It lies immediately anterior to the central sulcus, towards the posterior part of the frontal lobe. Its development differentiates it into an anterior (precentral) and a posterior (central) part. This gyrus is responsible for triggering voluntary motor functions. It contains large "Betz" cells, which are responsible for sending impulses through the pyramidal tract to the spinal cord and then to the muscles. **Clinical function: In clinical terms, the right precentral gyrus plays a crucial role in controlling and executing movement on the left side of the body. Movement representation in this region is ordered from head to toe along the gyrus in a layout known as the motor homunculus. Damage or injury to this area may result in motor deficits, such as decreased movement, weakness, or changes in dexterity on the contralateral side of the body. The right precentral gyrus is often involved in conditions such as stroke or conditions causing focal brain lesions, such as tumors, where it can be evaluated for structural and functional integrity using imaging methods like MRI or CT and functionally tested with physical examination.**Genetic information: The genetic regulation of the right precentral gyrus's development and function is a complex process involving numerous genes. Despite ongoing research, the complete suite of genes influencing development and functioning of the gyrus has not been fully identified. Specific genetic disorders, such as deletions or duplications of genetic material, can disrupt normal precentral gyrus function and lead to abnormal motor control. Some studies such as those into monogenic disorders and copy number variations have begun to shed light on some of the gene-region interactions. However, like many brain regions, the exact genetic influences and interactions at play in the right precentral gyrus will require much more research to fully understand.
pheno54,right precuneus,Anatomy: The precuneus is a part of the superior parietal lobule, positioned on the medial side of the hemisphere. It lies posterior to the marginal branch of the cingulate sulcus and anterior to the parieto-occipital sulcus. The precuneus is essentially bounded by these sulci and the region shares borders with the cingulate cortex and the superior parietal cortex. The folding pattern of the precuneus varies greatly among individuals but typically exhibits a prominent central sulcus, around which a number of secondary sulci are often arranged.**Clinical function: The precuneus plays a crucial role in several essential cognitive functions. It is involved in episodic memory and visuospatial processing. It contributes to the process of recalling visual images from memory and to the comprehension of the spatial environment. Also, it plays a crucial role in consciousness and self-awareness. Studies have shown that the precuneus might be the coordinating hub for the brain network involved in highly integrated cognitive functions. It has been associated with the 'default mode' of brain function and this region often shows deactivation during task-related brain processes. Any malfunctioning or abnormalities in precuneus have been linked to Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and autism.**Genetic information: While direct genetic correlations to the precuneus are under research, several studies suggest that genetic differences can have effects on the functions and structure of the area. One such study suggested that the precuneus region may be sensitive to genetic factors involved in neurodegeneration. Some genes reportedly associated with precuneus including MAPT and APOE are also associated predominantly with Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, genetic predisposition toward larger volume of the precuneus has been noted. Some studies suggest the genetic contribution to the individual differences in functional connectivity within the default network including the precuneus, and that certain genetic profiles may confer resilience or risk via modulation of the functional coherence of the precuneus.
pheno55,right rostral anterior cingulate,Anatomy: The right rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) is a region of the brain situated in the frontal lobe, notably in the medial part of the cerebral cortex. It is a component of the limbic system, a crucial area involved in emotional processing. Specifically, the rACC is positioned on the medial surface of the cerebral hemispheres, arching over the corpus callosum, a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres. This area plays a role in multiple cognitive functions, primarily those associated with emotion, memory, and attention.**Clinical Function: The rACC is involved in various cognitive and emotional functions, including emotion formation and processing, learning, and memory. Dysfunction in this area is associated with numerous psychiatric disorders. The rACC is of particular clinical interest due to its apparent involvement in depression and anxiety disorders. For example, abnormally high activity in the rACC has been linked to major depressive disorder. Similarly, it has also been implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), with research suggesting that decreased volume or activity in the rACC may contribute to symptoms such as inattention and impulsivity.**Genetic Information: While the specific genes governing the function and development of the rACC are not entirely understood, several genes have been implicated in its function. For instance, the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) has been associated with structural differences in this region. Certain variations in the 5-HTT gene appear to influence the development and connectivity of the rACC, potentially predisposing individuals to mood and anxiety disorders. Other genetic factors potentially influencing the rACC include the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene, which plays a key role in neuroplasticity, and genes involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and glutamate.
pheno57,right superior frontal,Anatomy: The right superior frontal gyrus is part of the frontal lobe, which is the largest of the four major lobes of the human brain. It is located in the dorsal part of the frontal lobe and is separated from the middle frontal gyrus by the superior frontal sulcus. The right superior frontal gyrus, like most parts of the brain, is involved with many cognitive functions. It is one of the last brain areas to mature, often not fully developing until early adulthood. It is also one of the brain regions most often associated with individual differences in brain structure.**Clinical function: Clinically, the right superior frontal gyrus is implicated in a range of functions. This includes the initiation of voluntary movement, the inhibition of inappropriate behaviors, and decision-making capabilities. It is also associated with self-awareness and coordination of information from other brain regions. Damage to this area can result in difficulties in these functions, potentially manifesting in conditions such as apathy, impulsivity, poor judgement, or motor problems. Studies also point to the possible involvement of the right superior frontal gyrus in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, where changes in its structure or function could contribute to the symptoms.**Genetic information: The genetic information of the right superior frontal gyrus has largely been studied in the context of neurodevelopmental disorders and psychiatric conditions. For example, variations in certain genes have been associated with changes in the structure or function of the right superior frontal gyrus, leading to a higher risk of developing these disorders. Also, researchers are now using genetic information to try to understand the basis of individual differences in brain structure and function. More specifically, the study of gene expression patterns in the right superior frontal gyrus can provide insights into the processes that regulate brain development and functioning.
pheno56,right rostral middle frontal,Anatomy: The right rostral middle frontal region is a part of the prefrontal cortex situated in the frontal lobe of the brain. The prefrontal cortex is divided into three functional and structural regions, and the rostral middle frontal region is one of these regions. It is involved in multiple functions, including motor processing, cognition, and personality expression. It is recognized for its thick cortical tissue and grossly visible inward folds or convolutions called gyri, which increase the surface area of the brain and therefore, its processing potential.**Clinical Function: This specific area of the brain has been implicated in a variety of complex cognitive processes, including problem-solving, planning, abstract reasoning, and cognitive flexibility. Although it does not directly execute motor functions, it is involved in high-level planning of complex motor actions and decision-making processes. Studies also suggest the involvement of the right rostral middle frontal in stress response, working memory, attention, and personality traits. Dysfunctions or abnormal changes in this area have been observed in various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.**Genetic Information: From a genetics perspective, the human brain’s morphology, including the right rostral middle frontal gyrus, is influenced by various genetic factors. Several studies have identified the involvement of gene loci in the cortical thickness of this region. Some genes identified include BCL2L1, RERE, PIWIL1, and IFI6. The hypothesis is that these genes might influence the thickness of cortical tissue through mechanisms related to cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. Studies also associate polymorphisms of serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) with structural alterations in the middle frontal gyrus, which could be related to several mental health disorders, including anxiety and depression. However, the complex interplay between various genetic factors and environmental influences that shape the structure and function of the right rostral middle frontal gyrus is still not fully understood and is a topic of ongoing research.
pheno58,right superior parietal,Anatomy: The right superior parietal lobule is an area of the brain positioned posterior to the central sulcus, at the upper part of the parietal lobe, and anterior to the occipital lobe. It forms part of the dorsal stream of the visual system and is comprised of Brodmann areas 5 and 7. It is involved in processing spatial awareness, navigation, and proprioception, and is responsible for integrating sensory information from different modalities, particularly determining spatial sense and navigation.**Clinical function: In a clinical context, the right superior parietal lobule plays a crucial role in patient's spatial awareness and body image. Disruptions, damage, or lesions in this part of the brain can lead to various neurological deficits like hemispatial neglect, an inability to pay attention to objects or stimuli on the opposite side of the body, disorders of body image and spatial relation. It's also implicated in conditions like Balint's syndrome, a visual attention and motor syndrome that leads to inability to perceive the visual field as a whole. It also has a role in motor functions, as it's involved in planning and guiding movements especially with respect to the orientation and direction of the movement with respect to external space.**Genetic information: There is not an extensive amount of information regarding the genetic aspects of the right superior parietal lobule specifically that is presently available. However, recent genetic studies have discovered numerous genes associated with the overall structure and function of the parietal lobe. For instance, the gene MCPH1, commonly associated with the condition Microcephaly, has been found to affect brain size, notably of the parietal lobe. More research is currently underway on the genetics of brain structure, including areas like the superior parietal lobule.
pheno60,right supramarginal,Anatomy: The right supramarginal gyrus is part of the parietal lobe of the human brain, located towards the posterior region of the cerebral hemisphere, slightly above the lateral sulcus (also known as Sylvian fissure). This structure forms part of a broader region known as the inferior parietal lobule, along with the adjacent angular gyrus. In terms of its internal structure, it is composed of six layers of neurons, a typical characteristic of a neocortical region.**Clinical function: In clinical terms, the right supramarginal gyrus plays critical roles in numerous cognitive processes. It is involved in spatial orientation, the perception and manipulation of visual information, and language processing. Besides, it has a specific role in phonological processing and working memory. Damage to this area can lead to various forms of dyslexia and other forms of language deficits. Interestingly, this region is also implicated in empathy, as research has shown that it is activated when we attempt to perceive things from another's point of view.**Genetic information: Though there isn’t enough distinct information on the specific genetic architecture of the right supramarginal gyrus, the genetic basis of brain structure and function are generally established through a complex interplay of numerous genes. Numerous neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders that involve alterations in the structure or function of the supramarginal gyrus are known to have a substantial genetic component, including dyslexia and schizophrenia. Furthermore, gene expression profiles can vary widely across different regions of the brain, indicating that the specific genes active in the right supramarginal gyrus may differ from those active in other brain regions. However, more detailed genetic studies are required to better understand the specific role of genes in the development and functioning of the right supramarginal gyrus.
pheno61,right transverse temporal,Anatomy: The right transverse temporal gyrus, also known as Heschl's gyri, is a part of the brain located within the Sylvian fissure or lateral sulcus, on the superior temporal gyrus. It houses the primary auditory cortex, responsible for processing auditory information. The right transverse temporal is part of the parietal lobe encompassing Brodmann areas 41 and 42. It is critical for decoding complex sound properties and is pivotal in speech and music perception. **Clinical function: In a clinical setting, the right transverse temporal gyrus plays a crucial role in the perception and interpretation of sounds. It provides the primary inputs to our auditory pathway, directly receiving sensory information related to sound from the ear before the information is further processed in other brain areas. Dysfunction or damage to this area could result in auditory processing disorders, impacting an individual’s ability to understand speech, perceive music, or localize sounds, possibly leading to conditions such as dyslexia, central auditory processing disorder (CAPD), tinnitus, or hyperacusis.**Genetic Information: Genes may play a role in the formation and function of the right transverse temporal gyrus. However, specific genetic markers or mutations linked directly to this brain area are not clearly defined. Much of brain development and function, including that of the right transverse temporal gyrus, is determined by a complex interplay between multiple genes and environmental factors. Researchers do explore genetic syndromes (such as those involve chromosomal aberrations or monogenic disorders) where aberrant brain anatomy is present - including alterations in temporal lobe structures. However, it requires further study to identify any specific genetic factors relevant to the right transverse temporal gyrus.
pheno62,right insula,Anatomy: The right insula is a small region of the cerebral cortex situated within the lateral sulcus, positioned deep in the brain. Its anterior part is covered by the frontal and temporal lobes while the posterior part is capped by the parietal lobe. The insula is further divided into anterior and posterior subdivisions, reflecting different functional modalities. Its unique gyral and sulcal patterns show huge inter-individual variability. It consists of approximately 7 - 9 short insular gyri converging towards an apex at the insular pole, separated by deep insular sulci.**Clinical function: Primarily, the right insula plays a pivotal role in high-level cognitive control mechanisms and awareness, processing information related to pain, recognizing emotions in others, and empathy. As it receives inputs from sensory areas, it plays a significant part in integrating sensory information with emotional responses. Additionally, it aids in giving a sense-of-body ownership, motor control and planning. That is why impairments or damage to this region can lead to a variety of clinical effects, including deficits in social cognition, emotional processing, and insensitivity to pain. Right insular stroke has been associated with cardiac changes and dysphagia. **Genetic information: The genetic basis of the right insula is yet to be fully understood. However, alterations in certain genes have been shown to impact the structure and functionality of the insula. Studies involving twins indicate that insular volume has a genetically mediated component, with heritability estimates being around 80%. Genes like ZNF804A and COMT, associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, have been found to correlate with alterations in the insula. Variations in the DNA sequence or copy number in these genes may contribute to insula abnormalities and potentially influence an individual's susceptibility to these mental disorders.
pheno66,left basal forebrain,Anatomy: The left basal forebrain is an area situated in the frontal and medial regions of the brain. Generally, its composition includes several structures such as the nucleus basalis, diagonal band, septal nuclei, and substantia innominata. Two primary projections originate from this region, the first heading towards the neocortex and the second directed to the hippocampus. The left basal forebrain principally plays a vital role in the production and maintenance of acetylcholine, a vital neurotransmitter for cognition and memory functions.**Clinical function: In the clinical context, the left basal forebrain is primarily associated with cognitive functions as well as sleep and wakefulness. The deterioration or damage of this brain region has been related to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's as it significantly impacts memory and attention. It also positively influences cortical activation and sleep-wake cycle through cholinergic neurons. There is a high concentration of cholinergic neurons in the left basal forebrain, whose widespread connections extend to the entire cerebral cortex. Any injury or compromise to these neurons can result in significant cognitive deficits.**Genetic information: Genes, including CHRM1, CHRM3, and CHRNA4 genes, are critically involved in cholinergic neurotransmission in the left basal forebrain. These genes are accountable for producing proteins that form the channels and receptors for acetylcholine, integral to brain function. Any mutations or alterations in these genes might result in cognitive impairments or neurodegenerative diseases. More specifically, certain identified genetic mutations have been linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease, a condition that has an established correlation to abnormal functioning of the left basal forebrain.
pheno63,cerebellar vermal lobules I V,Anatomy: Cerebellar vermal lobules I - V comprise the anterior lobe of the cerebellum, a major part of the human brain responsible for motor control. The lobules are numbered from the top (superior) part of the vermis in a downward (inferior) direction. They are tightly compact and consist of white matter surrounded by grey matter. Each lobule is divided into separate folia with several layers of varying types of cells, including Purkinje cells considered the primary output cells of the cerebellar cortex. The cerebellar vermis communicates with the rest of the brain via three major peduncles, through which deliver signals related to movement and coordination.**Clinical function: The cerebellar vermal lobules I–V primarily control fine motor movements, balance, and coordination. They receive sensory input from the spinal cord and other parts of the brain, then integrate this information to produce precise timing and force generation of movements. They also contribute to motor learning. Lesions or damage to these lobules can lead to ataxia, a neurological disorder marked by wobbly movements and unsteady gait. Other disorders linked to the anterior cerebellum include dysmetria, an inability to judge distances accurately, and dysdiadochokinesia, an inability to perform rapid alternating movements.**Genetic information: Although specific genetic information about cerebellar vermal lobules I-V is limited, various inherited genetic conditions can affect the cerebellum's overall development and function, including conditions marked by vermal hypoplasia or dysplasia. Examples include Joubert syndrome and Dandy-Walker syndrome, both of which are associated with mutations in multiple genes. However, it is believed that variations in hundreds of different genes might influence cerebellum's structure and function and how it is impacted by disease. Significant genetic research is ongoing to better understand the complex gene interactions in the cerebellum.
pheno64,cerebellar vermal lobules VI VII,Anatomy: The cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII, also known as the simple lobule and the superior semilunar lobule respectively, constitute central parts of the cerebellum, a region crucial for motor control and coordination. The cerebellum, located at the base of the skull, is split into two hemispheres and a central portion known as the vermis. Each hemisphere consists of eight lobules and the vermis consist of ten, among them are lobules VI and VII. These lobules are made up of white matter on the inside, creating tree-like structures called arbor vitae and gray matter on the outside, densely packed with Purkinje cells.**Clinical function: The main role of lobules VI and VII is to execute refined voluntary movements and to maintain posture and equilibrium, ensuring fluid and controlled physical actions. The major functions include planning, timing, coordinating, and executing movements, fine-tuning motor activities, and integrating sensory information with motor outputs. If damaged, symptoms may include unsteady walking, tremors, difficulty with rapid movements and inability to perform fine motor tasks.**Genetic information: Several genetic disorders can affect the development and function of the cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII. Joubert syndrome, for example, can cause malformation or underdevelopment of these lobules, leading to loss of motor control. This condition is linked to numerous genes, including INPP5E, AHI1, and CEP290, involved in primary cilia formation. Dandy-Walker syndrome, characterized by the underdevelopment of vermal lobules VI and VII, is associated with mutations in several genes including FOXC1 and ZIC1. These genes are crucial for brain development and function. Genetic studies continue to explore the complex interplay of various genes in the proper development and functioning of the cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII.
pheno67,right basal forebrain,Anatomy: The right basal forebrain (BF) is located at the base of the anterior part of the brain, ventral to the striatum. The right BF is composed of different structures, including the nucleus basalis, medial septal nuclei, dorsal pallidum, and the substantia innominate. It is interconnected with cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. It is known to contain large cholinergic neurons, among others, which are involved in learning and memory. **Clinical function: The right basal forebrain plays a crucial role in cognition, including learning, memory and attention. It is involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The integrity of the basal forebrain cholinergic system is essential for several cognitive functions, including perceptual attention and short-term memory. Damage or dysfunction of the right basal forebrain can lead to cognitive impairments, such as difficulties with memory recall and attention deficit disorders.**Genetic information: Several genes have been identified that play a role in the development and function of the basal forebrain. For instance, the homeobox gene Nkx2-1 is essential for the generation and specification of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). Mutations in this gene can lead to dysfunctions in these neurons and may be linked to cognitive deficits. Other genes like Gbx1 and Lhx8 also play significant roles in the development of BF. Understanding the genetic factors controlling the development and function of the right basal forebrain may shed light on the pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
pheno65,cerebellar vermal lobules VIII X,Anatomy: The cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X, also known as the posterior lobules, are located at the lower part of the cerebellum, connected with the spinal cord and brainstem. They are vital components of the posterior lobe of the cerebellum. The lobules are divided into three subsets, each varying in size and shape: the Declive (VIII), Folium and Tuber (IX), and the Pyramis, Uvula, and Nodulus (X). Each lobule is characterized by intricate folia, or folds, covered with grey matter and interconnected with white matter forming a distinct tree-like formation, the 'arbor vitae.' **Clinical Function: The cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X play pivotal roles in maintaining body posture and balance, coordinating voluntary movements, and facilitating motor learning. While lobule VIII is largely associated with movement control, lobules IX and X are crucial for vestibulo-ocular reflexes, enhancing eye movement and maintaining visual stability during head movements. Disturbances or damage to these lobules can lead to difficulty with coordination and balance, tremors, dysarthria (problems with speech muscles), gait ataxia, and nystagmus (rapid, involuntary eye movements).**Genetic Information: Specific genetic abnormalities affect the cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X and have been associated with various disorders. For example, deletions or duplications in the 7q36 gene have been linked to cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy of cerebellar vermal lobules VIII and X, leading conditions like Dandy-Walker malformation. Additionally, mutations in genes like GRID2 have been tied to different cerebellar disorders. Genetic information related to cerebellar vermal lobules VIII-X is continuously being explored, providing crucial insight into various movement, cognitive, and psychiatric disorders.
pheno69,CSF,Anatomy: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless body fluid found in the brain and spinal cord. It is produced in the choroid plexus of the brain, which is a network of blood vessels in the walls of the ventricles. From its place of production, it flows through the ventricles and into the subarachnoid space, covering the brain and spinal cord. It is then reabsorbed into the blood stream. There is about 125 to 150 ml of CSF at any one time, and about 500 to 600 ml is generated every day.**Clinical function: CSF has several important functions in the clinical setting. It provides mechanical protection, acting as a cushion to defend the brain from impact. It also maintains a stable environment, providing essential nutrients and removing waste products. CSF helps to regulate intracranial pressure and provides buoyancy to the brain, essentially allowing the brain to float within the skull. In terms of clinical evaluation, analysis of CSF can provide valuable diagnostic information for various conditions such as meningitis, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors.**Genetic information: The study of CSF in genetic research and diagnostics is being increasingly recognized. It is understood that CSF contains cell-free DNA, which can be utilized for molecular diagnostic applications. Genetic abnormalities and mutations that are present in primary brain tumors, for example, can be detected in the CSF. This non-invasive approach can be useful for monitoring disease progression and response to treatment. Recent studies suggest that the analysis of the CSF's "genomic landscape " can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system disorders, adding a new dimension to personalized medicine.
pheno68,Brain stem,Anatomy: The brainstem is a critical part of the central nervous system, extending from the base of the brain to the spinal cord. Its structure comprises of three main components: the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain. The medulla relays signals between the brain and spinal cord and controls autonomic functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. The pons primarily serves as a message station between different areas of the brain and plays key roles in controlling arousal and regulating respiration. The midbrain controls many vital, primitive functions such as reactions to sight and sound.**Clinical function: Highly significant in daily function, the brainstem is responsible for a multitude of automatic processes critical for life, often referred to as ‘autonomic’ or ‘involuntary’ functions. This includes the control of heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing, as well as reflexive responses such as coughing, sneezing and vomiting. The brainstem also controls levels of wakefulness and consciousness, in addition to helping mediate general alertness via the reticular formation. Furthermore, 10 of the 12 cranial nerves originate from the brainstem, giving rise to various sensory and motor functions.**Genetic information: Some genetic disorders can affect the functioning of the brainstem, contributing to a wide range of neuromuscular conditions. Alterations or mutations in certain genes can negatively impact the formation and function of the brainstem, leading to diseases such as Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia, and Joubert Syndrome. Other genetic conditions linked with brainstem involvement include Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), where certain gene mutations can alter serotonin-producing cells in the brainstem, and Moebius Syndrome, where the development of cranial nerves that originate in the brainstem is affected. Genetic research focusing on the brainstem continues, aimed at identifying the genetic basis of numerous brainstem disorders to aid early diagnosis and the development of effective therapies.
pheno70,X3rd ventricle,Anatomy: The 3rd ventricle is a small, narrow, midline cavity of the brain, part of the ventricular system. It's located within the diencephalon or interbrain, a central region of the brain composed of the thalamus and hypothalamus among other areas. It is a symmetric structure, shaped like a narrow funnel moving from anterior to posterior. The 3rd ventricle communicates anteriorly with the lateral ventricles via the interventricular foramen, also known as the foramen of Monro, and inferiorly with the fourth ventricle via the cerebral aqueduct.**Clinical Function: The 3rd ventricle, like other ventricles in the brain, is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that provides several important functions including providing buoyancy and protection to the brain, immunity, and the circulation of nutrients. Disruptions or abnormalities in the ventricles, such as enlargement or swelling of the 3rd ventricle, could potentially lead to conditions like hydrocephalus, whereby excess CSF accumulates in the ventricles causing increased pressure in the brain. In clinical neuroimaging, the size, shape and position of the third ventricle provides important information for diagnosis and management in a variety of neurological conditions.**Genetic information: While no specific genes are known to directly control the formation and function of the 3rd ventricle, it is clear that its development and maturation are regulated by a complex interplay of various genes responsible for brain development in general. Disorders linked to mutations in such genes can indirectly impact the ventricular system and lead to a range of neurological pathologies. For example, ciliopathies – disorders of the cellular cilia (small, hair-like structures on cell surfaces) – can disrupt normal CSF flow leading toward ventricular enlargement and hydrocephalus. Therefore, genetic studies in neurological disorders often consider the ventricular system, and thus the 3rd ventricle, as part of the larger network affected in these conditions.
pheno71,X4th ventricle,Anatomy: The 4th ventricle is one of the four connected fluid-filled cavities within the human brain. This structure is shaped somewhat like a tent and contains cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the central nervous system. It's within the hindbrain and located between the cerebellum and the dorsal aspect of the pons and medulla. The floor or diamond-shaped area is called the rhomboid fossa, and it contains several structures related to the central nervous system, such as the median aperture and lateral apertures, which allow for the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid.**Clinical Function: The 4th ventricle has significant clinical functions related to the circulation and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. It is connected to the central canal of the spinal cord, which allows the cerebrospinal fluid to flow down and around the spinal cord and brain, providing a protective cushion for the nervous system. In addition to providing protection, this fluid helps to supply nutrients to neural tissue and remove metabolic waste. Blockage or malformation of the 4th ventricle can lead to hydrocephalus, which is a harmful accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.**Genetic Information: Genetic factors play a role in the development and functioning of the 4th ventricle. Many genes are implicated in the neurodevelopmental process. For example, genetic mutations affecting the SHH (Sonic hedgehog) signalling pathway may result in holoprosencephaly, where the ventricular system may be malformed. Another condition, Dandy-Walker malformation, which involves an enlarged 4th ventricle and incomplete cerebellar development, has also been linked to genetic factors, although the exact genes involved are not yet clearly identified. Further research is needed to unravel the genetic complexities associated with the 4th ventricle.
pheno78,left caudate,Anatomy: The left caudate nucleus forms an integral part of the basal ganglia system, a group of nuclei in the brain associated with control of voluntary motor movements, learning, cognition, and emotion. It's located deep within the cerebral hemispheres, above the thalamus and below the dorsal surface of the frontal lobe. The human caudate is divided into the head, body, and tail. It has a C-shape, curving around the putamen, another structure of the basal ganglia.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left caudate plays a vital role in various cognitive processes and behaviors including executive function, learning, and memory. It's involved in motor function control and decision making. Dysfunction or damage to this region can lead to numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Decreased volume or abnormal activity in the left caudate has been implicated in conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia.**Genetic information: The genetics related to the left caudate primarily focus on genes associated with neurodegenerative disorders. For instance, mutations in the HTT gene cause Huntington’s disease, characterized by the loss of neurons in the caudate. Various genes like DRD2, COMT, and DAT1 influence dopamine function in the caudate, thereby impacting its role in motor control and cognitive functions. Research also points towards a genetic influence on the overall size and volume of the caudate. The left caudate's function and structure can be affected by individual genotypic variability, contributing to the pathogenesis of various psychiatric and neurological disorders.
pheno72,optic chiasm,Anatomy: The optic chiasm is a flattened, X-shaped structure located just anterior to the hypothalamus in the human brain. It forms the junction where the two optic nerves coming from each eye cross each other. This intersection allows the nerve fibers from the nasal half of each retina to cross over to the opposite side of the brain, while the fibers from the temporal half of the retina remain on the same side. Thus, the optic chiasm is an important pathway for the brain to receive visual information from both eyes.**Clinical function: The primary function of the optic chiasm is to transmit visual information from each eye to the corresponding half of the brain. Because some of the visual fibers cross over at the optic chiasm, the brain can process a significant part of the visual field from each eye. In this way, the optic chiasm contributes to binocular vision and visual perception of depth, which are essential for locating objects in our visual environment and navigating through space. Besides that, the optic chiasm can be affected by certain pathological conditions such as pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, optic nerve gliomas, and multiple sclerosis, all of which may cause visual field defects or even loss of vision.**Genetic information: The development and function of the optic chiasm depend on orchestrated actions of many genes. Early in embryonic development, axons are guided to the chiasm by signaling molecules like Netrin and Shh, encoded by genes NTN1 and SHH, respectively. Disrupted function of these genes can lead to anomalies such as optic nerve hypoplasia or achiasmia. Genes like PMCH, ROBO1, and ROBO2 are also important in maintaining visual pathway crossing at the chiasm. Changes (mutations) in these genes may cause diseases such as albinism and achiasma, a rare congenital condition characterized by absence or underdevelopment of the optic chiasm, leading to binocularly duplicated visual fields.
pheno74,left inferior lateral ventricle,Anatomy: The left inferior lateral ventricle, also known simply as the lateral ventricle, is one of four interconnected cavities or ventricles in the human brain. It is located in each cerebral hemisphere. Its structure is quite complex, widely spread throughout the brain, and envelops many integral parts of the brain. It's divided into an anterior horn, body, atrium, posterior horn, and an inferior horn. With each part located in a distinct section of the cerebral hemisphere, the lateral ventricles contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by the choroid plexus, which lines the ventricle.**Clinical Function: The left inferior lateral ventricle plays a significant role in maintaining the homeostasis of the brain's environment. It accomplishes this by housing and circulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This clear, colorless body fluid is essential in providing mechanical protection to the brain against injury through its cushioning effect. Additionally, the CSF helps in the removal of waste products from cerebral metabolism, provides the brain with necessary nutrients, and creates a stable ionic environment for the brain. Conditions such as hydrocephalus, colpocephaly, and ventriculomegaly can occur as a result of abnormalities in the ventricles of the brain.**Genetic Information: There isn't any specific genetic information that is directly linked to the left inferior lateral ventricle as it is mainly a physical structure. However, malformations or dysfunctions of the ventricular system, including the lateral ventricle, can often be traced back to genetic mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. Such conditions include Dandy-Walker syndrome and X-linked hydrocephalus, which result from mutations in the genes ZIC1, ZIC4, and L1CAM respectively. These disorders are often characterized by an enlarged or an abnormally shaped lateral ventricle, reflecting the critical role of these genes in ventricular development and function.*
pheno73,left lateral ventricle,Anatomy: The left lateral ventricle is one of the four fluid-filled cavities in the brain, specifically located in the left cerebral hemisphere. It exhibits a unique curved horseshoe-like shape teaming with extensions, known as horns. It consists of a central part (the body), and three extensions namely: the anterior (frontal), posterior (occipital), and inferior (temporal) horns. The ventricles' walls are composed of ependymal cells, and they communicate with each other and the spinal cord via foramen to allow the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).**Clinical function: The primary function of the left lateral ventricle, in coordination with other ventricles, is to produce, store, and circulate CSF which serves numerous critical roles in the central nervous system. Predominantly, CSF acts as a cushion for the brain, absorbs shock, and protects the brain and spinal cord from injury during impacts. It also delivers nutrients to and removes waste from the brain, besides helping regulate intra-cranial pressure. Disorders affecting the left ventricle, such as hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly, could impair these functions and lead to neurological symptoms and complications.**Genetic information: Though the formation and function of the lateral ventricles are not directly linked to a specific gene, several genetic abnormalities can affect the ventricles’ development and function. For example, variants in the FOXJ1 gene can disrupt the motility of ependymal cells, affecting CSF production and flow, leading to hydrocephalus. Disorders like Down Syndrome and Zellweger Syndrome, caused by genetic mutations, are also known to cause ventricular malformations. Additionally, the study of genetic influence in ventricular volume differences has underscored the complex polygenic nature of brain morphology, with clues pointing towards neurodevelopmental loci shared between lateral ventricular volume and related neurological disorders, such as Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder.
pheno75,left cerebellum exterior,Anatomy: The left cerebellum is a vital area of the brain located posteriorly, beneath the occipital lobes and above the brainstem. It consists of two hemispheres and the central area known as the vermis. The left cerebellum has a distinct folded appearance, akin to a tightly compact branching tree called the arbor vitae. This compact structure is comprised of gray matter (containing cell bodies called Purkinje cells) and white matter, and is integrated with three cerebellar peduncles that connect it to various areas of the brain and spinal cord. Its three main lobes - the anterior, posterior, and flocculonodular - are further divided into numerous smaller folds or folia, increasing the cerebellum's surface area.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left cerebellum is involved in various motor-related tasks, including coordination of voluntary movements, posture, and balance. It is also implicated in some cognitive functions such as attention and language processing. The cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, spinal cord, and other parts of the brain, and integrates these data to fine-tune motor actions. Damage to or dysfunction of the cerebellum can result in symptoms such as ataxia (lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements), dysmetria (lack of control of range of motion), and intention tremors, among other motor disorders.**Genetic information: The development and function of the cerebellum are influenced by a variety of genes. Several genetic conditions, including Joubert syndrome and Dandy-Walker syndrome, specifically affect the cerebellum and can consequently lead to motor and cognitive challenges. Mutations in genes such as CACNA1A, ATXN1, and ATXN2 have been linked to spinocerebellar ataxia, a degenerative disorder affecting the cerebellum. Recent genetic research has also discovered associations between alterations in the DNAJC5 gene and cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and dementia. However, the understanding of cerebellar genetics remains incomplete and is an active area of research.
pheno79,left putamen,Anatomy: The left putamen is a round structure located at the base of the forebrain. It's a part of the striatum, a subcortical part of the telencephalon. The putamen, along with the caudate nucleus, acts as an input to all other components of the basal ganglia system. It is situated within a loop of fibers known as the internal capsule, which separates it from the globus pallidus. Histologically, the putamen contains a higher density of acetylcholinesterase and GABAergic containing fibers than the caudate.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left putamen plays a critical role in a variety of motor and non-motor functions. It is particularly involved in the executive processing of motor planning, learning, execution, and control. The left putamen is linked with the "motor circuit" of the basal ganglia, enabling appropriate motor behavior. It also aids in the reinforcement of learning new habits and skills, procedural memory, eye movements and cognition. In various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Parkinson's, Huntington's and ADHD, an abnormal function or structure of the left putamen has been commonly observed.**Genetic information: Genetically, the left putamen does not carry any unique information itself, as it is a structure formed by neural cells which are programmed by genes present in every cell in the body. However, mutations in a number of genes, such as the HTT gene in Huntington's disease, have been associated with neurological conditions that impact the function of the putamen. With more research into these genetic influences, a better understanding of the putamen's complex role in brain function and disease may result. Understanding genetic variants that predispose to diseases involving the putamen can have implications in the risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of these conditions.
pheno77,left thalamus proper,Anatomy: The left thalamus, positioned in the left hemisphere of the brain, is an intricate structure and one of a pair that makes up the diencephalon, the other being the hypothalamus. It is situated just above the brainstem and constitutes approximately 80% of the diencephalon's mass. Divided into two significant parts, main and anterior nuclei, the left thalamus connects with other essential brain structures such as the cerebral cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. It also hosts a rich network of nerve fibers that link with the hippocampus, amygdala, and the basal ganglia, playing a pivotal role in transferring sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex.**Clinical function: The left thalamus serves many vital functions, including but not limited to, regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness. Its primary role involves transmitting sensory information received from the body to the cerebral cortex, which interprets and responds to the signal. As the 'gateway to the cortex,' it plays a crucial part in our ability to perceive and react to physical stimuli. It's involved in motor control, and processing information regarding auditory, visual, and tactile senses. Any damage to the left thalamus can lead to sensory impairment, sleep disorders, memory abnormalities, and even emotional disturbances due to its communication with the limbic system.**Genetic information: Thalamic development and function are regulated by a complicated interplay of genes. It's generally believed that several gene families are involved in its formation, including homeobox genes, basic helix-loop-helix genes, and winged helix genes, among others. Mutations or alterations in these genes can directly or indirectly impact the thalamus's structure and ability to send and receive neural signals. Several neurological and psychiatric conditions are associated with thalamic dysfunction, affecting its structure or disrupting the genes involved in thalamic development. A better understanding of the genetic aspects of thalamic function may provide new insights into neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.
pheno76,left cerebellum white matter,Anatomy: The cerebellum, located at the back of brain, is divided into two hemispheres. The left cerebellum white matter, also known as the arbor vitae due to its tree-like appearance, is the area inside the cerebellum where myelinated nerve fibers are located. These nerve fibers create connections to and from the cerebellum, linking it with several different parts of the brain and spinal cord. The white matter houses three main groups of fibers which include climbing and mossy fibers serving as inputs, and Purkinje fibers being the only output of the cerebellum.**Clinical function: The left cerebellum white matter plays a vital role in coordinating voluntary movements initiated by the cerebrum. It makes these movements accurate and precise by comparing the intended movement, which is relayed from the cerebral cortex, with the actual movement, which is fed back into the cerebellum through peripheral nerves. It helps in controlling our posture, ensuring balance, and maintaining muscle tone. It's also thought to have a role in motor learning. Damage or abnormalities in this area can lead to conditions such as ataxia, tremor, or dysmetria- conditions characterized by impaired balance and coordination.**Genetic Information: Just like other parts of the brain, the development and function of the cerebellum white matter are controlled by several genes. Mutations in these genes may cause various types of cerebellar ataxias, which are typically characterized by degeneration of the cerebellum white matter. For example, mutations in the SPTBN2 gene can cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 5 (SCA5), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia. Another example is a mutation in the TSEN54 gene, which leads to Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia, a group of related conditions that primarily affects the development of the brain, resulting in problems with movement and intellectual disability. Research into the exact genetic causes of cerebellum white matter abnormalities is ongoing, and more genes that influence their development and function are likely to be discovered in the near future.
pheno80,left pallidum,Anatomy: The left pallidum is part of the basal ganglia system, located within the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The globus pallidus, referred to as the pallidum, is divided into two parts - the external (GPe) and internal (GPi) segments. The pallidum's position permits its interaction with other neuroanatomical structures such as the striatum, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. These connections allow the pallidum to play a vital role in complex motor functions.**Clinical function: The left pallidum, along with the right pallidum, is integral to the regulation of voluntary movement. It functions to inhibit and modify signals from the cerebral cortex, acting as a gatekeeper to prevent excessive, extraneous signals from reaching the muscles. Disorders of the pallidum, such as in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, result in abnormal movement, ranging from hypokinetic conditions like muscle rigidity and bradykinesia, to hyperkinetic issues like chorea, dystonia, and tremors.**Genetic information: The exact genetic features influencing the structure and function of the left pallidum are currently not fully identified. However, specific genetic mutations have been associated with disorders affecting the pallidum. For instance, the PARK2 (Parkin) and PINK1 genes mutations are associated with familial forms of Parkinson's disease, leading to a degeneration of the globus pallidus among other brain structures. A mutation in the HTT gene is responsible for Huntington's disease, another condition affecting the pallidum. Further research is needed to fully understand the exact genetic influence on the health and pathology of the left pallidum.
pheno81,left hippocampus,Anatomy: The left hippocampus is a key structure inside the left cerebral hemisphere of the brain, part of the limbic system. This small organ is seen to have a curved shape, somewhat like a seahorse, hence the name 'hippocampus', from the Greek words 'hippos’ meaning ‘horse’, and 'kampos' meaning ‘sea monster’. The structure is divided into two major sections: Ammon's horn (cornu ammonis) and the dentate gyrus. These regions can be further subdivided into subregions CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, and the subiculum. The hippocampus is essential for the formation and recall of memories, especially autobiographical and spatial memories.**Clinical Function: Clinically, the left hippocampus is fundamentally involved in encoding verbal memory and control of language function. Patients with damage to the left hippocampus often suffer from verbal memory deficits and may have impaired recall of verbal information. Its involvement in spatial memory means it also plays a crucial role in navigation. The left hippocampus has been found to be critical in many disease states such as Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, PTSD, and acute stress disorder, which are commonly associated with hippocampal volume changes and memory loss.**Genetic Information: Genetically, various genes have been identified to influence the function and structure of the left hippocampus. For instance, the APOE4 allele is a well-known risk factor for hippocampal atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. Other genes related to Left Hippocampus structure and function include genes involved in synaptic plasticity such as BDNF and genes involved in neurodevelopment like DISC1. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have further identified multiple genetic loci associated with hippocampal volume. Epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation and histone modification, are also crucial for hippocampal neuronal functions and responses to environmental influences.
pheno83,left accumbens area,Anatomy: The left accumbens area, also known as the nucleus accumbens, is a region located in the brain's basal forebrain, more specifically, in the ventral striatum. This structure is divided into two parts: the core and the shell, both having different morphological features and connections. It collects input from various brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and sends output mainly towards the ventral pallidum and the thalamus.**Clinical function: The left accumbens area plays a significant role in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. It is widely recognized for its key function in the reward circuit of the brain, implicating it in addiction and substance abuse disorders. This region is also involved in the integration of motivational and emotional information to guide behavior, and therefore disturbances in its functioning can result in mood disorders like depression. It is involved in motor activity and has increasingly been linked with the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.**Genetic information: In regard to its genetic aspect, the left accumbens area is affected by genetic links and polymorphisms associated with psychiatric conditions. For instance, there is a significant genetic overlap between schizophrenia and structure in the accumbens area, suggesting that the genes influencing this overlap might do so through mechanisms that are common to both schizophrenia and accumbens structure. Moreover, it has been found that a gene involved in dopaminergic activity, DAT1, is associated with individual differences in reward responsiveness, which implicates the accumbens area. Variants of genes related to dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate, all neurotransmitters acting in the accumbens area, are associated with addictive behaviors and mood disorders as well.
pheno82,left amygdala,Anatomy: The left amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structured found deep within the anterior region of the temporal lobe. It forms an essential part of the limbic system, mainly involved in processing emotions and survival instincts. The amygdala is divided into several nuclei grouped under two categories, basolateral and corticomedial, each performing distinct functionalities. The left amygdala communicates with multiple areas of the brain and primarily receives inputs from the sensory cortical areas while providing outputs to the hypothalamus and the brainstem for reaction to stimuli. **Clinical function: The left amygdala plays a pivotal role in the emotional modulation of memories and decision-making processes. It is primarily associated with fear conditioning and emotional response. Its increased activity is linked to anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression. This structure is crucial for assigning emotional value to events and stimuli in the environment, processing of social emotions such as empathy and embarrassment, and for appropriate emotional reaction. Moreover, it enables the brain to develop a quick reaction to threats, facilitating the fight or flight response.**Genetic information: Genetic influences on the size and activation of the amygdala have been investigated through various studies. Particular attention has been given to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, such as neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (NTRK2) and serotonin transporter (5-HTTLPR), which have been associated with structural and functional changes in the left amygdala. More recent research is increasingly exploring the role of epigenetic factors, which may mediate the effects of environmental influences on amygdala structure and function. Studies into the genetic aspects of the amygdala aim to elucidate the biological underpinnings of numerous psychiatric disorders, contributing to their complex genetic architecture.
pheno85,left vessel,Anatomy: The term 'left vessel' would typically refer to any blood vessel residing on the left side of the body. However, without specified context, we may consider the 'Left Anterior Descending' (LAD) artery, a significant blood vessel of the heart. The LAD is the largest branch of the left coronary artery and supplies blood to the front and main wall of the left ventricle. Traditionally, it is considered the most critical coronary artery and the one most commonly associated with sudden death.**Clinical function: Clinically, the LAD artery holds immense importance due to the role it plays in supplying oxygenated blood to the left side of the heart, which is primarily responsible for pumping blood to the rest of the body. Any blockage or narrowing (stenosis) of the LAD can drastically impede the blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to severe complications, including myocardial infarction or 'heart attacks'. Therefore, the health and integrity of the LAD are crucial for maintaining cardiovascular function and overall health.**Genetic information: As part of the cardiovascular system, the development and functioning of the LAD, like other vessels, is controlled by a complex interaction of numerous genes. Variations or mutations in these genes can predispose an individual to cardiovascular diseases, among which the blockage or disease of the LAD is common. Genetic factors are also believed to play a role in how the coronary arteries, including LAD, respond to risk factors such as high cholesterol or blood pressure. While the exact genes and mechanisms are being intensely researched, examples include variations in the APOB and PCSK9 genes affecting cholesterol levels and thus the risk of coronary artery disease.
pheno87,right inferior lateral ventricle,Anatomy: The right inferior lateral ventricle, more commonly referred to as the right inferior horn of the lateral ventricle, is part of the ventricular system in the brain. It extends into the temporal lobe and communicates with the central part of the lateral ventricle and the third ventricle via the interventricular foramen. The inferior horn is lined with ependymal cells and filled with cerebrospinal fluid. Its walls are formed by the hippocampus and other structures of the limbic system. **Clinical function: The primary function of the right inferior lateral ventricle is the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which provides essential cushioning and protection for the brain. The CSF also plays a crucial role in maintaining the brain’s homeostasis by helping to remove waste and to transport hormones and nutrients. In clinical terms, abnormalities in the size or shape of the ventricles, or their CSF content, can be indicative of various pathological conditions such as hydrocephalus, intracranial pressure, or neurodegenerative disorders.**Genetic information: The formation and development of the ventricular system, including the right inferior lateral ventricle, are complex processes regulated by a variety of genes such as Pax6, Emx2, and Fgf8. Changes or mutations in these genes can potentially impact the size, shape, and function of the ventricles. For instance, studies have highlighted the association between genetic variations in FOX and RBFOX family genes with lateral ventricle volume. However, the direct influence of genetics on the right inferior lateral ventricle specifically is not well-established and remains an area of ongoing research.
pheno84,left ventral DC,Anatomy: The Left Ventral Dorsal Column (DC) is a part of the white matter structure in the spinal cord that plays a crucial role in transmitting sensory information from the body to the brain. This collection of nerve fibers ascends the back section, or dorsal part, of the spinal cord, transmitting information related to deep touch, proprioception (i.e., the perception or awareness of the position and movement of the body), and vibratory sensation. These white matter bundles are segmented into the fasciculus gracilis, which carries information from the lower body, and the fasciculus cuneatus, responsible for transmitting signals from the upper body and arms.**Clinical function: Clinically, the left ventral DC is instrumental in providing our brains with continuous updates on our bodily movements. In conditions where the DC gets damaged, it may lead to loss of proprioception, vibration detection and discriminative touch, mostly demonstrable on the contralateral side of the body. Diseases or injuries such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, neurosyphilis, or B12 deficiency can damage this pathway leading to sensory deficits. This pathway is an area of interest in neurological evaluations and helps in understanding the location of damage along the sensory tracts.**Genetic Information: Currently, there is limited specific genetic information related to the left ventral DC itself. However, research has identified several genes essential for the general development and function of the spinal cord and its structures. For instance, mutations in the SOX3 gene have been known to cause congenital abnormalities in the spinal cord. Also, the formation and proper function of myelinated neurons, which are crucial components of the spinal cord tracts, are regulated by several genes like PMP22, MPZ, PRX, etc. More research is needed to precisely understand the genetic aspects linked to the specific development and functioning of the left ventral DC.
pheno86,right lateral ventricle,Anatomy: The right lateral ventricle is a structure located within the brain, one part of a system of four communicating cavities that are continuous with the central canal of the spinal cord. The right lateral ventricle is situated in the right hemisphere of the brain, extending from the frontal lobe to the occipital lobe, and in depth into the temporal lobe. It is divided into an anterior (frontal), a posterior (occipital), and an inferior (temporal) horn. It communicates with the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (foramen of Monro).**Clinical function: The right lateral ventricle plays a crucial role in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain and spinal cord, as well as in the clearance of waste products. Any disruption or blockage to this can lead to a condition known as hydrocephalus, where an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain. This can cause increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to a host of complications. The volume of the lateral ventricles can also be increased in several neurological conditions, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the specific clinical functions of the right lateral ventricle alone are not well elucidated.**Genetic information: The formation and function of the right lateral ventricle, like all structures of the brain, are regulated by various genes acting in a complex interplay. Several genes are known to be involved in the development of the ventricular system, including those that code for transcription factors and signaling molecules that guide neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Among these genes are FOXJ1, which helps lining cells to produce cerebrospinal fluid, and SHH, which signals the development of structures around the ventricles. Genetic mutations or alterations can potentially lead to malformations of the ventricles and associated neurological conditions.
pheno88,right cerebellum exterior,Anatomy: The right cerebellum exterior is a part of the brain that occupies the posterior cranial fossa behind the brainstem. This renal-like structure is flattened laterally and is divided into two hemispheres—the right hemisphere (which is being discussed) and the left hemisphere. The surface of the cerebellum is composed of a grey cortex, finely convoluted and folded to increase its surface area. The cerebellum exterior is separated from the cerebrum by a membranous sheet, the tentorium cerebelli, and is connected to the brainstem through three stalks of white matter, also known as cerebellar peduncles.**Clinical function: The right cerebellum functions primarily to control precise and coordinated movements, posture, and balance. It also facilitates motor learning, allowing us to perform tasks like learning to ride a bike or playing an instrument. Damage or abnormalities in this region can lead to symptoms like ataxia (loss of coordination), dysmetria (misjudging the distance or range of a movement), and dysdiadochokinesia (difficulty with rapidly alternating movements). **Genetic Information: While the right cerebellum doesn't have unique genetic information different from other parts of the brain, genetic mutations can affect its structure and function. For instances, Spinocerebellar ataxia, a genetic disorder, leads to degradation of cells in the cerebellum, and Friedreich’s ataxia is associated with mutations in a gene that can cause degeneration in the cerebellum. Moreover, the ongoing research in the field of neurogenetics is continually expanding our understanding of how specific genes influence the development, function, and health of the right cerebellum.
pheno89,right cerebellum white matter,Anatomy: The right cerebellar white matter, also known as arbor vitae, forms the inner layer of the cerebellum. As per its name, it appears white due to myelinated axons that link the cerebellum to the rest of the brain and spinal cord. This white matter consists of numerous small bundles of myelinated fibers that originate from three paired cerebellar peduncles. These fibers then branch off extensively throughout the cerebellum, providing a tree-like appearance (thus the name 'arbor vitae'), and contrasting with the grey matter cortex.**Clinical function: The primary function of the right cerebellar white matter is facilitating communication between the cerebellum and other brain areas. It is involved in transmitting both motor and sensory information. This includes carrying input from the spinal cord about unconscious proprioception or unconscious awareness of body positioning. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in motor coordination and precision of voluntary movements, balance, motor learning, and some cognitive functions such as attention and language processing. Impairments of these structures can lead to a range of cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia, dysarthria, and dysmetria.**Genetic information: Variations in white matter volume, including the right cerebellar white matter, have been linked to genetic factors, although the specific genes are yet to be fully identified. Studies in twin populations and familial inheritance patterns suggest a heritable component in white matter microstructure. Certain neurodegenerative diseases like Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's, known to affect white matter, have genetic components associated with them. There are also certain rare genetic disorders, such as leukodystrophies, which specifically affect the white matter in the brain. Understanding the genetic architecture of the cerebellar white matter may hold the key to better understanding and treating various cerebellar and neurodegenerative diseases.
pheno90,right thalamus proper,Anatomy: The right thalamus proper is a medium-sized structure located in the right cerebral hemisphere, between the cerebral cortex and midbrain. It is oval-shaped and comprises of several nuclei which include the anterior, medial, and lateral dorsal nuclei. Other structures include the pulvinar, lateral and medial geniculate bodies. The right thalamus functions as a key relay and integration center, connecting various subsystems of the brain. Its location and extensive connectivity place it in a central position to regulate information flow in the brain.**Clinical Function: Clinically, the thalamus serves as an essential hub in the processing of sensory information, funneling inputs such as visual, auditory, and somatosensory to appropriate regions of the cerebral cortex. It is highly involved in the regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness. Notably, it plays a significant role in maintaining the arousal mechanism and cognitive functions such as memory and learning. Disorders or injuries involving the right thalamus may result in numerous pathological states, including thalamic pain syndrome, cognitive difficulties, sleep disorders, and mood dysregulations. **Genetic Information: Few specific genes have been directly linked to thalamic development or function. Nonetheless, several genes seem to influence the normal development and function of the thalamus. For instance, the Dlx family of genes, particularly Dlx2, is implicated in the formation and differentiation of thalamic neurons. Mutations in these genes may potentially result in thalamic dysfunction. Additionally, the gene Shh is expressed in the thalamus and seems to control thalamic axon guidance and connectivity. Nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1) gene is also found to be highly expressed in the right thalamus and has been associated with sleep regulation.
pheno91,right caudate,Anatomy: The right caudate is a part of the brain's striatum along with the putamen and the nucleus accumbens. It forms part of the basal ganglia and it is involved with motor behaviors and cognition. The caudate loops about the thalamus, with which it is intimately associated, and follows the lateral ventricle, curving around to form the tail which runs within the ventricle's temporal horn. The caudate is specifically divided into a tail, body, and head, with the head constituting the most anterior part.**Clinical function: The clinical function of the right caudate is varied and extensive. It is primarily involved in the planning and execution of movement pathways, partially through its interaction with the putamen. Additionally, the right caudate is associated with various forms of cognitive functions, playing a role in learning, memory, and reward behavior along with the function of integrating sensory input from multiple sources and implementing appropriate responses. Abnormalities in the right caudate tend to be associated with conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, Huntington’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease.**Genetic information: Several genes have been related to the development and function of the caudate nucleus. Among these, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) gene plays a significant role in the survival and growth of neurons in the caudate nucleus while DRD2 gene influences the density and sensitivity of dopamine receptors in the caudate, affecting its signaling. Mutation of genes like HTT can lead to conditions like Huntington’s disease, characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons in the caudate. Moreover, alterations in caudate volume and shape have been linked to variations in genetic polymorphisms – particularly a mutation in the COMT gene, which encodes for an enzyme that degrades catecholamines such as dopamine.
pheno92,right putamen,Anatomy: The right putamen is part of the basal ganglia in the brain, which is involved in various functions including motor control and learning. It is positioned at the base of the forebrain and is spherical in shape, lying lateral to the globus pallidus and forming a part of the outer boundary of the internal capsule. Bilateral putamen on either side of the brain contribute to the dorsal striatum with caudate nucleus. They are interconnected with several other structures in the brain, including the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, the primary motor cortex, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the superior parietal lobule.**Clinical function: Clinically, the right putamen is crucial in the modulation of movements and influence of various types of learning. It plays a key role in the regulation and control of voluntary movement. Abnormalities or damage to the putamen can lead to a range of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, which are characterized by a loss of motor control. It also participates in reinforcement learning and is thought to be part of the reward system in the brain, encoding the expected reward value of an action.**Genetic information: Genetic influences on the right putamen are linked to several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. For instance, variants in the Huntington gene are associated with a degeneration of cells in the putamen leading to Huntington's disease. Polymorphisms within dopamine-related genes have been linked to the volume and function of the putamen, implicated in conditions like Parkinson’s disease and Schizophrenia. Genes associated with the synthesis, release, re-uptake, and receptor binding of various neurotransmitters like dopamine, GABA, and glutamate are thought to shape the structure and function of the putamen.
pheno95,right amygdala,Anatomy: The right amygdala is a part of the limbic system, located deep within the temporal lobe in the brain. This small, almond-shaped structure is composed of several nuclei including the basolateral, centromedial, and cortical nuclei. Each plays a different role, with the basolateral involved in fear conditioning and the cortical dealing with social cognition. The amygdala is one of the most interconnected areas in the brain, with connections extending to and receiving signals from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and other key regions. **Clinical Function: The right amygdala plays crucial roles in motivation and emotion, particularly those related to survival instincts like fear and aggression. It significantly influences the processing of negative emotions and fear responses like freezing or increased heart rate. Numerous studies show the right amygdala's involvement in anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias due to its role in fear conditioning. It also plays a significant role in social and emotional learning, affecting how individuals react in social situations.**Genetic Information: Genetic differences in the amygdala can contribute to various psychological disorders. The right amygdala's size and activity can be influenced by genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in specific genes. For instance, some studies found that genetic variations in the glucocorticoid receptor gene - associated with stress hormone regulation - can impact right amygdala size and increase susceptibility to anxiety and depression. Genetic research on the right amygdala is ongoing, and further discoveries could increase our understanding of its role in various mental health disorders.
pheno94,right hippocampus,Anatomy: The right hippocampus, located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain, is an integral part of the overall hippocampal formation. Its unique seahorse-like structure includes several parts: the dentate gyrus, cornu ammonis, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. These regions connect with each other and the rest of the brain through a complex system of white matter tracts known as the hippocampal circuit. The left and right hippocampi also have cerebral asymmetry. Certain studies suggest the right hippocampus may be larger and more structurally complex compared to the left. **Clinical function: The right hippocampus is primarily associated with memory, especially spatial memory and navigation. It’s also involved in cognitive processes such as learning, attention, and emotional responses. Neuroimaging studies have revealed structural changes in the right hippocampus associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's or other memory disorders, epilepsy, and mental health conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Furthermore, damage to the right hippocampus can lead to anterograde amnesia, which is the inability to form new memories. **Genetic information: Genetic factors largely influence the structure, function, and health of the right hippocampus. Certain genetic variations, for example, are linked to increased hippocampal volume. Diseases such as Alzheimer's or temporal lobe epilepsy also have a genetic component that can affect the hippocampus. In Alzheimer's, specific genes (like APOE4) contribute to hippocampal atrophy, while in epilepsy, genes such as LGI1 and DEPDC5 have been implicated in hippocampal sclerosis. Current research is examining the complex genetic architecture of the right hippocampus for further insights into brain function and disease.
pheno93,right pallidum,Anatomy: The right pallidum, also known as the right globus pallidus, is a subcortical structure located deep within the brain, in the basal ganglia. Along with the left pallidum, it forms a dual structure called the globus pallidus. These structures are divided into two segments: the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and the globus pallidus externus (GPe). The right pallidum is spherical in shape and juxtaposed with the putamen, and together they form the lentiform nucleus. The pallidum features numerous paths that communicate with the striatum, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, and other areas within the basal ganglia.**Clinical function: The right pallidum plays a critical role in the regulation of voluntary movement. It is a part of the indirect pathway within the basal ganglia circuit, which works by inhibiting movements. It inhibits the motor function through the release of GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid) onto the thalamus. Studies suggest that it may be intensely involved in the initiation and regulation of movements, as well as in learning and habit formation. Abnormalities or damage of the pallidum can cause movement disorders, the most notable one being Parkinson's disease, characterized by muscle rigidity, tremors, slowing of physical movement, and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement.**Genetic information: The existence of specific genetic correlates for the structure of the right pallidum is not well established within the scientific community, given the complex nature of brain development and function, which involve multifaceted interplay between a vast number of genes. Nevertheless, research has unraveled some associations between genes and features of the basal ganglia that affect the pallidum. An instance includes mutations in the PARK genes, which are associated with Parkinson's disease. Also, abnormal glutamate signaling and metabolic pathways involving the GAD1 and GAD2 genes, which are pertinent for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA, have been proposed to influence the function of the basal ganglia, including the pallidum.
pheno96,right accumbens area,Anatomy: The right accumbens area is part of the ventral striatum, a region located in the basal forebrain. It is a small, ovoid nucleus that is near the anterior commissure and ventrolateral to the septum pellucidum. The accumbens region consists of two main parts - the core and the shell. The neuronal makeup of this region includes medium spiny neurons, fast-spiking interneurons, and others. This area is tightly linked with several other brain structures - including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and dopamine-containing regions of the midbrain - by complex neuronal circuits.**Clinical Function: The right accumbens area plays a crucial role in the reward circuit of the brain. It is associated with motivation, pleasure, and addiction. It is involved in the conditioning of rewarding experiences and the anticipation of these rewarding experiences. It is also implicated in the perception of pleasure, goal-oriented behavior, and enforcement learning. Dysfunction of this area contributes to several psychiatric conditions, including depression, schizophrenia, and particularly substance abuse disorders.**Genetic Information: The right accumbens area, like other brain structures, is influenced by a myriad of genes that control its development, function, and plasticity. For example, the DRD2 gene might affect the functioning of the accumbens by influencing the availability of dopamine receptors. Various genetic variants have been associated with a higher risk of addiction, potentially through alterations in the structure or function of this area. The study of the genetics involved in the right accumbens area is complex and ongoing, with many other implicated genes such as DISC1, BDNF, and genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission.*
pheno98,right vessel,Anatomy: In the context of the human body anatomy, the term "right vessel" isn't particularly specific or distinct. However, interpreting the context may refer to several structures that tend to be on the right side of the body like the right coronary artery that supplies the heart muscle, the right subclavian artery supplying upper body, etc. One notable structure is the right coronary artery that originates from the right aortic sinus. Its pathway takes it to the right side of the heart where it provides blood supply to the right atrium, parts of the left ventricle, and almost all of the right ventricle.**Clinical function: The primary clinical function of any vessel in the body, including ones on the right side, is to transport blood. This function is essential for delivering necessary substances such as oxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the different parts of the body. For example, the right coronary artery carries oxygenated blood to the heart muscle to ensure its functioning. If disrupted, it may lead to conditions such as coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. **Genetic information: The genetics related to the right vessels can primarily be associated with genetic predispositions to certain vascular disease conditions. Numerous genes contribute to the development, structure, and function of blood vessels, and mutation in these genes can lead to disorders. However, the most significant correlation between the genetics and right vessels would be in diseases like coronary heart disease where genetic factors like familial hypercholesterolemia significantly increase the chance of developing blockages in the arteries including right coronary artery. However, the linkage between specific genes and the anatomy or health of specific, right-side vessels is still an actively researched topic.
pheno97,right ventral DC,Anatomy: The right ventricle of the heart, often abbreviated as right ventral DC, is one of the four chambers of the human heart. This chamber is found in the lower section of the heart. Its primary function is to receive deoxygenated blood from the right atrium to pump it further into the lungs for oxygenation. Its structure is crescent-shaped and composed of two parts: the trabecular part, which is closest to the apex of the heart, and the conus arteriosus part, located near the pulmonary artery. These areas are separated by the supraventricular crest.**Clinical Function: The clinical or physiological function of the right ventricle, or right ventral DC, is crucial to pulmonary circulation. Deoxygenated blood from the body flows into the right atrium, is pushed through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, and then pumped into the lungs via pulmonary arteries when the right ventricle contracts. In the lungs,, the blood picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide, restarting the cycle when the oxygenated blood flows into the left side of the heart. Furthermore, assessment of the right ventricle's performance is essential, as its failure could lead to conditions like Right ventricular hypertrophy or right-sided heart failure.**Genetic Information: The formation of the right ventricle is controlled by a complex interplay of several genes during embryonic development. The TBX5, a T-box transcription factor gene, plays a critical role as it interacts with other genes such as NKX2.5 and GATA4 to regulate cardiac specification and morphogenesis. Mutations in these genes might cause congenital heart diseases, including malformed or malfunctioning right ventricles. Additionally, studies have hinted at the influence of the MYH6 gene on ventricular septal defects and dangling chordae in the right ventricle. However, more research is needed to fully understand the genetic aspect of right ventricle anatomy and function.
pheno99,gray matter,Anatomy: Gray matter, a component of the central nervous system (CNS), is primarily composed of neuronal cell bodies, glial cells, and capillaries. In the brain, gray matter envelopes the superficial layers, forming the cerebral cortex, where complex cognitive tasks are processed. Additionally, it forms deep nuclei, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, and hypothalamus. It also forms an H-shaped column in the spinal cord, encompassing the dorsal and ventral horns. Its grayish appearance is largely due to a lack of myelination compared to the white matter, allowing for faster synapse-impact information processing.**Clinical function: Gray matter serves various crucial roles in the human CNS, driving a multitude of higher cognitive functions. Key tasks within its purview include muscle control, sensory perception including seeing and hearing, memory storage, emotions, speech, decision making, and self-control. Gray matter volume has been associated with a multitude of neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. Lower gray matter volume in specific brain regions is thought to be predictive of disease risk and symptom severity.**Genetic information: Gray matter, like all CNS structures, is greatly influenced by our genetic blueprint. Several genetic markers are associated with variations in gray matter volume, location, and neuronal connectivity. Variations in the COMT, BDNF, APOE, and DISC1 genes have been linked to differences in overall gray matter volume and function. Moreover, specific genes, like the FOXP2 gene, have been implicated in localized gray matter development affecting language and speech. It's also observed that gray matter volume is highly heritable, with studies estimating a heritability of up to 80% in certain brain regions. Genetic research in this area helps elucidate the complexities of brain disorders and their inheritance patterns.
pheno100,white matter,Anatomy: White matter makes up about half of the human brain and is so named due to its pale appearance resulted from myelination, the insulating layer that forms around nerves. It lies beneath the gray matter cortex, extended deep into the brain. It comprises mainly of glial cells and myelinated axons, forming long-range connections between neurons that allow regions of the brain to communicate with each other. Tracts or bundles of these axons, make up the major highway of neural signals that help different parts of the brain interact.**Clinical function: White matter is primarily responsible for transmitting signals and information between different parts of the brain, and from the brain to the rest of the body. Each tract of white matter facilitates specific functions. For example, the corticospinal tract carries motor commands from the brain to the body's muscles. Notably, the efficiency and speed of these transmissions are greatly increased by the myelin sheath wrapped around the axons. Alterations in white matter have been linked to cognitive dysfunction and neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.**Genetic Information: Several genes are implicated in the development, maintenance, and function of white matter, such as those governing the production of myelin, neuronal migration, and axon guidance. Mutations in these genes can lead to white matter diseases. Notable among these are the leukodystrophies, a range of genetic disorders characterized by white matter degeneration. Some schizophrenia-related genes also appear to influence white matter integrity. Additionally, white matter exhibits plasticity throughout life, reflecting its sensitivity to both genetic and environmental influences.
pheno101,total brain volume,Anatomy: The human brain is a complex organ constituted by a variety of structural regions interacting through complicated neural networks. It has three major divisions: the forebrain, the midbrain, and the hindbrain. The forebrain includes the cerebrum and limbic system. The cerebrum with its highly convoluted cortical surface is responsible for higher-order functions. The midbrain links the forebrain and the hindbrain, and houses structures crucial for motor control and auditory and visual processing. The hindbrain includes the cerebellum, medulla, and pons, critical for maintaining balance, coordinating movement, and controlling vital functions. Together, these parts contribute to the total brain volume (TBV).**Clinical Function: The total brain volume represents a vital index of the brain’s structural state and health. TBV diminishes with age, and excessive shrinkage or atrophy could be a sign of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Neurological conditions, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, have been associated with a reduced TBV. A decrease or increase in TBV could also be seen in psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Moreover, TBV measurements can be useful in monitoring disease progression and response to treatments. Total brain volume provides crucial insights into the overall health, structure, and function of the brain.**Genetic Information: Genetic factors significantly influence brain anatomy and, therefore, total brain volume. The heritability of TBV has been estimated between 66-97%. Numerous genome-wide association studies have identified certain genetic variations associated with differences in TBV. For example, the common genetic variant denoted as rs72823592, located in the HMGA2 gene, has been shown positively associated with TBV. In addition, some rare genetic disorders can cause excessive brain growth (megalencephaly) or diminished brain size (microcephaly). Therefore, the variance in TBV amongst individuals could be partially attributed to their genetic makeup.
